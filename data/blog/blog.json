      "body": "In March 2025, Norway's Minister of Digitalisation and Public Governance, Karianne Tung, made headlines by urging all government and public organizations to prepare for potential disruptions to American cloud services.\n\n## The Message\n\nSpeaking at the Digitaliseringskonferansen, Minister Tung emphasized that Norwegian organizations need contingency plans in case data transfers to the US become legally problematic. While she noted she didn't specifically use the term \"exit strategy,\" she stood firmly behind the concept.\n\nThe core message: Organizations that rely on Microsoft, Google, and other US cloud providers should have a plan ready for what happens if access to these services is disrupted - whether through regulatory changes, geopolitical events, or legal conflicts.\n\n## Why Now?\n\nSeveral factors are driving this urgency:\n\n1. **EU-US Data Privacy Framework fragility** - The framework enabling transatlantic data transfers depends on executive orders and oversight bodies that can shift with political changes.\n\n2. **CLOUD Act concerns** - US law requires American providers to hand over data to US authorities regardless of where it's stored.\n\n3. **Geopolitical instability** - Political decisions, international crises, or trade disputes could disrupt access to US cloud services.\n\n4. **Norwegian dependency** - NSM (Norwegian National Security Authority) reported that over 80% of protected data and systems will be in cloud solutions within ten years - largely outside Norwegian control.\n\n## The Reality Check\n\nMinister Tung acknowledged the challenge: \"It's naive to think we can move away from Microsoft and Google tomorrow. We are so dependent on those companies today, and it's demanding.\"\n\nThis isn't about immediate migration - it's about preparedness. Having a strategy means understanding:\n- What data and services you have in US cloud platforms\n- What alternatives exist\n- How quickly you could migrate if needed\n- What would break if access was lost\n\n## European Alternatives\n\nOrganizations looking to reduce US cloud dependency can consider:\n\n**Nordic providers:**\n- NetNordic (Norway)\n- Elastx (Sweden)\n- UpCloud (Finland)\n\n**European providers:**\n- Scaleway (France)\n- Hetzner (Germany)\n- OVHCloud (France)\n\n## Denmark Leading by Example\n\nMinister Tung has been following Denmark's approach closely. The Danish Digitalisation Ministry has announced plans to migrate from Windows to Linux and replace Office 365 with LibreOffice - with the goal of eliminating Microsoft dependency before year-end.\n\nTung indicated Norway is watching to \"see if we can think similarly.\"\n\n## What This Means for Organizations\n\nEvery organization using US cloud services should:\n\n1. **Inventory your cloud dependencies** - Know what you have where\n2. **Assess criticality** - What would the impact be if access was lost?\n3. **Evaluate alternatives** - What European or on-premise options exist?\n4. **Document a migration path** - Even if you never use it\n5. **Test your assumptions** - Can your critical systems actually run elsewhere?\n\n---\n\n## Sources\n\n- [Digi.no: Ber alle ha «exit-strategien» klar om Google og Microsoft blir ulovlig](https://www.digi.no/artikler/tung-ber-alle-ha-exit-strategi-klar-i-tilfelle-google-og-microsoft-blir-ulovlig/556705)\n- [Digi.no: Exit-strategi krever nasjonal sky-løsning](https://www.digi.no/artikler/kommentar-exit-strategi-krever-nasjonal-sky-losning/557001)\n- [Digi.no: Dansk Microsoft-exit - Ser om vi kan tenke likt i Norge](https://www.digi.no/artikler/folger-noye-med-pa-dansk-microsoft-utfasing-ser-om-vi-kan-tenke-likt-i-norge/559422)\n- [Computas: Amerikanske skyplattformer - Risikovurdering, exit-strategi og alternativer](https://computas.com/artikkel/amerikanske-skyplattformer-risikovurdering-exit-strategi-og-alternativer/)\n- [Regjeringen.no: Cloud Computing Strategy for Norway](https://www.regjeringen.no/en/documents/cloud-computing-strategy-for-norway/id2484403/)"

      "body": "The European Union is taking decisive action to address its overwhelming dependence on American cloud providers. In October 2025, the European Commission announced a €180 million tender for sovereign cloud services - a clear signal that digital sovereignty is now a strategic priority.\n\n## The Problem: 70% US Control\n\nEuropean organizations face a stark reality: approximately 70% of EU cloud infrastructure is controlled by US hyperscalers - primarily Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. This creates significant concerns:\n\n- **Legal jurisdiction conflicts** - US laws like the CLOUD Act can compel American providers to hand over data, regardless of where it's stored\n- **Economic dependence** - Billions of euros flow to US tech giants annually\n- **Strategic vulnerability** - Critical European infrastructure depends on foreign providers\n- **Data protection uncertainty** - The EU-US Data Privacy Framework could be invalidated by courts, as happened with Safe Harbor and Privacy Shield\n\n## The EU's Response: SEAL Framework\n\nThe EU has developed the **Sovereignty, European values, Autonomy, and Locality (SEAL)** framework to classify cloud services by their sovereignty level:\n\n| Level | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| **SEAL-0** | No sovereignty requirements |\n| **SEAL-1** | Basic EU data residency |\n| **SEAL-2** | EU-headquartered provider, EU data processing |\n| **SEAL-3** | No foreign ownership, EU jurisdiction only |\n| **SEAL-4** | Full sovereignty - EU owned, operated, and controlled |\n\nThis framework gives organizations a clear way to assess their cloud providers and make informed decisions based on their sovereignty requirements.\n\n## €180 Million Investment\n\nThe European Commission's tender targets several key objectives:\n\n1. **Develop EU-native cloud capacity** - Fund European cloud providers to scale their infrastructure\n2. **Create interoperability standards** - Ensure portability between European providers\n3. **Support public sector migration** - Help government agencies move to sovereign cloud solutions\n4. **Build skills and expertise** - Develop European cloud engineering talent\n\n## European Alternatives Growing\n\nSeveral European cloud providers are positioning themselves as sovereign alternatives:\n\n**France:**\n- **Scaleway** - Part of Iliad Group, focused on developer experience\n- **OVHCloud** - Europe's largest cloud provider, strong on data sovereignty\n\n**Germany:**\n- **Hetzner** - Known for competitive pricing and strong infrastructure\n- **IONOS** - Business-focused cloud from United Internet\n\n**Nordic:**\n- **Elastx** (Sweden) - Kubernetes-native, GDPR-compliant\n- **UpCloud** (Finland) - High-performance European cloud\n- **NetNordic** (Norway) - Regional provider with sovereignty focus\n\n## Cloud and AI Development Act\n\nAlongside the funding initiative, the EU is advancing the **Cloud and AI Development Act**, which aims to:\n\n- Establish common standards for cloud services in the EU\n- Create certification schemes for sovereign cloud providers\n- Define requirements for public sector cloud procurement\n- Address AI training data sovereignty\n\n## What This Means for Organizations\n\nEuropean organizations should:\n\n1. **Understand your SEAL requirements** - What level of sovereignty do you actually need?\n2. **Evaluate European alternatives** - Many can match hyperscaler capabilities for common workloads\n3. **Plan for hybrid approaches** - Use sovereign cloud for sensitive data while maintaining flexibility\n4. **Monitor regulatory developments** - Requirements are evolving rapidly\n5. **Consider multi-cloud strategies** - Avoid trading one vendor lock-in for another\n\n## The Bigger Picture\n\nThe EU's investment signals a long-term commitment to digital sovereignty. While European providers may not match the scale of AWS or Azure today, the combination of funding, regulation, and growing demand is creating conditions for a more competitive European cloud market.\n\nFor organizations in regulated industries, government, or those handling sensitive data, the question is no longer whether to consider sovereign cloud options - it's how quickly to move.\n\n---\n\n## Sources\n\n- [European Commission: Cloud and edge tender (€180M)](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/commission-launches-eu180-million-call-deploy-cloud-and-edge-computing-capabilities)\n- [The Register: EU sovereign cloud initiative](https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/15/eu_sovereign_cloud/)\n- [InfoQ: European Cloud Sovereignty Framework](https://www.infoq.com/news/2025/02/eu-cloud-sovereignty-framework/)\n- [ENISA: EU Cybersecurity Certification Scheme for Cloud Services](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/eucs-cloud-service-scheme)"

      "body": "When developers spin up an Azure Function with a Service Bus trigger, or configure an AWS Lambda with SQS, they're making a quick decision that could cost their organization millions in migration debt. The problem isn't that these services are bad - they're excellent. The problem is that nobody asked whether portability mattered.\n\n## The Lock-in Tax\n\nResearch shows that 89% of organizations have adopted multi-cloud strategies, yet many remain trapped in inflexible arrangements. The numbers tell the story:\n\n- **30-50% surprise costs** from egress fees when moving data out of a cloud provider\n- **£894 million** estimated cost to UK public bodies from overreliance on single providers\n- **42% of companies** considering moving workloads back on-premises to escape vendor dependencies\n\nBasecamp famously projected **$7 million in savings over five years** by avoiding cloud lock-in. But the real cost isn't just financial - it's the inability to respond to change.\n\n## How Lock-in Happens\n\nLock-in rarely comes from a deliberate architectural decision. It creeps in through convenience:\n\n### The Developer Path of Least Resistance\n\nA consultant joins your project for six months. They know Azure well, so they:\n\n1. Use Azure Service Bus with the native SDK (not the AMQP abstraction)\n2. Write Azure Functions with native triggers (not containerized with CloudEvents)\n3. Store data in Cosmos DB (when PostgreSQL would have worked)\n4. Send logs directly to Application Insights (not via OpenTelemetry)\n\nEach decision makes sense in isolation. The code works. The deadline is met. The consultant moves on.\n\nSix months later, your organization needs to:\n- Evaluate AWS for cost optimization\n- Consider European cloud providers for sovereignty\n- Run services on-premise for a government client\n\nAnd now you discover that \"migration\" means \"rewrite.\"\n\n### The Standards Exist - We Just Don't Use Them\n\nThe frustrating truth is that portable alternatives exist for almost everything:\n\n| Proprietary Approach | Portable Alternative |\n|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Azure Service Bus SDK | AMQP protocol (or Dapr pub/sub) |\n| AWS Lambda triggers | OCI containers with CloudEvents |\n| Application Insights | OpenTelemetry |\n| Azure AD direct integration | Standard OAuth/OIDC |\n| Cosmos DB | PostgreSQL, CockroachDB |\n\nCloud providers support these standards. Developers just don't use them because the proprietary path is faster to implement and better documented.\n\n## The Real Problem: No Organizational Strategy\n\nMost organizations have no policy requiring portable solutions. The pattern repeats:\n\n**No incentive for portability.** Developers and consultants are measured on delivery speed, not long-term maintainability. Choosing the portable option takes more time upfront.\n\n**No visibility into lock-in.** Technical debt from vendor dependencies doesn't show up in sprint metrics or quarterly reviews.\n\n**No cost feedback loop.** Cloud invoices go to finance, not developers. The person provisioning Cosmos DB never sees the bill.\n\n**Fragmented infrastructure.** Without governance, teams spin up duplicate services. You end up with three different message queues, two databases, and four ways to store files - each with different vendor dependencies.\n\n## Breaking Free: Practical Strategies\n\n### 1. Adopt Dapr for Infrastructure Abstraction\n\nThe [Distributed Application Runtime (Dapr)](https://dapr.io/) provides a portable runtime that abstracts cloud-specific services. The 2025 State of Dapr Report shows:\n\n- **96% of developers** report time savings\n- **60% see productivity gains of 30%+**\n- AWS usage grew from 22% to 38% as teams realized they could switch providers\n\nWith Dapr, your code calls standardized APIs for pub/sub, state management, and service invocation. The infrastructure binding happens in configuration, not code.\n\n```yaml\n# Switch from Azure Service Bus to RabbitMQ by changing config, not code\napiVersion: dapr.io/v1alpha1\nkind: Component\nmetadata:\n  name: pubsub\nspec:\n  type: pubsub.rabbitmq  # Was: pubsub.azure.servicebus\n  metadata:\n    - name: host\n      value: \"amqp://localhost:5672\"\n```\n\n### 2. Containerize Everything\n\nPackage workloads as OCI containers rather than cloud-specific functions. This gives you:\n\n- Portability across any Kubernetes cluster\n- Local development that matches production\n- No runtime lock-in to Lambda, Azure Functions, or Cloud Run\n\n### 3. Create an Exit Strategy Before You Need One\n\nThe [EU Data Act](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/factpages/data-act-explained) is changing the landscape. Since 12 September 2025, cloud providers must comply with new switching obligations - removing obstacles to effective switching between providers or to on-premise infrastructure. By 12 January 2027, all switching charges including data egress fees will be prohibited entirely.\n\nThis regulatory pressure means providers can no longer use egress fees as a lock-in mechanism. But don't wait for regulation to force your hand:\n\n- Document all cloud service dependencies\n- Identify which services have portable alternatives\n- Estimate migration effort for critical workloads\n- Test portability by deploying to a second provider\n\n### 4. Establish Governance Without Blocking Delivery\n\nCreate lightweight policies:\n\n- **Approved services list** - What databases, queues, and storage options are supported?\n- **Abstraction requirements** - When must code use Dapr or OpenTelemetry instead of native SDKs?\n- **Review triggers** - New infrastructure provisioning requires brief architecture review\n\nThe goal isn't to slow down development - it's to make the portable choice the easy choice.\n\n### 5. Make Costs Visible\n\nRoute cloud cost data to development teams. When the developer who provisioned the premium-tier database sees the monthly bill, behavior changes.\n\n## The Portability Mindset\n\nVendor lock-in isn't inevitable. It's the result of thousands of small decisions made without considering long-term consequences.\n\nThe organizations that will thrive are those that treat portability as a feature, not an afterthought. They'll be able to:\n\n- Negotiate better rates by credibly threatening to leave\n- Respond to regulatory changes without panic\n- Adopt new services without rewriting existing code\n- Run workloads where it makes business sense, not where they're trapped\n\nThe time to think about your exit strategy is before you need one.\n\n---\n\n## Sources\n\n- [EU Data Act Explained - European Commission](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/factpages/data-act-explained)\n- [EU Data Act Cloud Switching Provisions - Taylor Wessing](https://www.taylorwessing.com/en/global-data-hub/2025/eu-data-act---understanding-the-issues/gdh---aeu-data-act-cloud-switching-provisions)\n- [Cloud Switching Under the EU Data Act - Greenberg Traurig](https://www.gtlaw.com/en/insights/2025/9/cloud-switching-under-the-eu-data-act)\n- [State of Dapr 2025 Report](https://www.diagrid.io/blog/the-state-of-dapr-2025-report)\n- [CNCF 2025 State of Dapr Report](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cloud-native-computing-foundation-releases-2025-state-of-dapr-report-highlighting-adoption-trends-and-ai-innovations-302416413.html)\n- [Vendor Lock-in Prevention Multi-Cloud Strategy Guide 2025](https://buzzclan.com/cloud/vendor-lock-in/)\n- [Avoiding Cloud Vendor Lock-In: A 2025 UK Guide](https://www.impossiblecloud.com/magazine/avoiding-cloud-vendor-lock-in)\n- [4 Best Practices to Avoid Cloud Vendor Lock-in](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcloudcomputing/tip/4-best-practices-to-avoid-cloud-vendor-lock-in)\n- [Dapr Official Documentation](https://docs.dapr.io/concepts/overview/)"

      "body": "Who controls your data? Who can access it? And what happens if that access is cut off?\n\nThese questions are driving a fundamental shift in how Norwegian organizations think about cloud infrastructure. It's no longer just about cost optimization - it's about sovereignty, control, and national security.\n\n> Gartner predicts that by 2030, more than 75 per cent of all enterprises outside the US will have a digital sovereignty strategy, supported by a sovereign cloud strategy.\n>\n> — [Gartner](https://www.channelweb.co.uk/news/2025/geopatriation)\n\nGartner calls this trend \"[geopatriation](https://www.channelweb.co.uk/news/2025/geopatriation)\" - moving from hyperscalers to local or regional cloud providers. Their 2025 survey found that **61% of Western European CIOs** said geopolitical factors will increase their reliance on local or regional cloud providers.\n\nThis isn't about rejecting cloud technology. It's about choosing who you trust with your nation's data.\n\n## Why Sovereignty Matters Now\n\nThe geopolitical landscape has changed. The comfortable assumption that American cloud providers will always be available and trustworthy is being questioned at the highest levels.\n\n**The legal reality:**\n- **CLOUD Act** - US law requires American companies to hand over data to US authorities, regardless of where it's stored\n- **No jurisdictional protection** - Data in Azure's Norwegian region is still subject to US law\n- **Executive order dependency** - The EU-US Data Privacy Framework can be revoked with a signature\n\n**The geopolitical reality:**\n- Denmark's Defense Intelligence Service has [identified the United States as a security threat](https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/10/europe/denmark-intelligence-report-intl) for the first time - warning that the US \"uses economic power, including threats of high tariffs, to enforce its will and no longer rules out the use of military force, even against allies\"\n- Norway's Minister of Digitalisation Karianne Tung has advised all organizations to [prepare exit strategies](/blog/2025-12-01-norway-exit-strategy/) from US cloud providers\n\nWhen a NATO ally officially classifies the US as a potential security concern, the implications for digital infrastructure cannot be ignored.\n\n## Norway and the Nordics: Taking Action\n\nNorwegian organizations are responding to these concerns with concrete investments in sovereign infrastructure.\n\n### Telenor's Skygard: Building Norway's Sovereign Infrastructure\n\nWhen Norway's largest telecom company Telenor [couldn't find a cloud provider meeting their security requirements](https://www.telenor.com/media/newsroom/announcement/telenor-hafslund-and-hitecvision-announces-2-4-billion-nok-investment-in-oslo-data-center/), they decided to build their own.\n\nIn 2024, Telenor partnered with energy company Hafslund and investor HitecVision to create **Skygard** - a NOK 2.4 billion (€200+ million) investment in sovereign Norwegian data centers.\n\n**Why they're building it:**\n- Norwegian security authorities requested data centers for sensitive national infrastructure\n- Need for \"trusted local alternative\" to global hyperscalers\n- Target customers: government agencies, critical infrastructure, financial services, healthcare\n\n**The message is clear:** When one of Norway's largest companies says they can't find a cloud provider they trust with sensitive data, it tells you something about the state of the market.\n\n### Green Mountain: Sovereign Infrastructure Already Operating\n\nFor organizations choosing colocation over hyperscalers, [Green Mountain's Norwegian data centers](https://greenmountain.no/) offer an established alternative.\n\nBuilt inside a former NATO ammunition store near Stavanger and powered by 100% renewable hydropower, their facilities host:\n- Banks and financial services\n- Government agencies\n- Cloud service providers\n\nThe appeal: **Tier III certified Norwegian infrastructure** under Norwegian jurisdiction, with among the lowest electricity costs in Europe.\n\n## The Business Case: Sovereignty AND Savings\n\nSovereignty isn't just about security - there's often a compelling cost argument as well. Companies that have moved away from hyperscalers report significant savings.\n\n### 37signals (Basecamp): Control and Cost Reduction\n\n37signals - the company behind Basecamp and Hey - [exited AWS entirely](https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/21/37signals_aws_savings/) and moved to colocation.\n\n**The results:**\n- Annual infrastructure bill dropped from $3.2 million to **under $1 million**\n- Projected five-year savings: **over $10 million**\n- **Full control** over their infrastructure and data\n- No dependency on a single US provider\n\nAs founder David Heinemeier Hansson wrote: the decision wasn't just about money - it was about regaining control over their own destiny.\n\n### Ahrefs: Independence by Design\n\nSEO software company Ahrefs [never migrated to cloud in the first place](https://www.theregister.com/2023/03/13/ahrefs_on_prem_savings/), calculating that AWS would cost them **$408 million more** over 2.5 years.\n\nBut beyond cost, they maintain complete control over their infrastructure - no dependency on US providers, no CLOUD Act exposure, no risk of service disruption due to geopolitical events.\n\n## The Hidden Exit Tax: Egress Fees\n\nWant to regain sovereignty over your data? First, you'll need to pay to get it out.\n\n**Egress fee reality:**\n- Moving 50TB costs **$3,500-7,000** in egress fees alone\n- A company with 5PB of archival data faces **$250,000** just to download it from AWS\n- Egress fees can add **30-50%** to monthly cloud bills unexpectedly\n\nThis is by design. Egress fees are \"deliberately designed to lock you into a single cloud provider\" - making it expensive to exercise your sovereignty.\n\n### The EU Data Act: Regulatory Support for Sovereignty\n\nThe [EU Data Act](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/factpages/data-act-explained), effective September 2025, introduces measures to protect businesses from unfair cloud contracts. By January 2027, switching charges including egress fees will be prohibited entirely for customers in Norway and the EU.\n\nThe EU is actively supporting organizations that want to regain control of their data.\n\n## The Real Numbers on Migration Costs\n\nBefore budgeting for migration, ask: **can you actually move?**\n\nIf your organization has built on vendor-specific services - Azure Functions with native triggers, AWS Lambda integrations, proprietary database APIs - the migration cost isn't just infrastructure. It's rewriting code. We covered this in detail in [Cloud Vendor Lock-in: The Hidden Cost of Developer Convenience](/blog/2025-12-06-vendor-lock-in-hidden-cost/).\n\nAssuming your workloads are portable, budget for these costs. According to [industry analysis](https://appinventiv.com/blog/cloud-migration-costs/), migration projects typically range widely based on complexity:\n\n**One-time migration costs:**\n- Simple migrations (lift-and-shift): **$50,000-200,000**\n- Complex enterprise migrations: **$600,000 to over $1 million**\n- Timeline: weeks for simple migrations, 12-24 months for complex transformations\n\n**Ongoing considerations:**\n- Colocation fees (rack space, power, bandwidth)\n- Hardware refresh cycles (typically 3-5 years)\n- Staff training or hiring\n- Software licensing changes\n\nThe investment in sovereignty is real - but so is the cost of dependency.\n\n## What This Means for Norwegian Organizations\n\n### 1. Assess Your Sovereignty Risk\n\nMap your critical systems to their infrastructure providers:\n- Which systems hold sensitive data?\n- Which are subject to US jurisdiction via CLOUD Act?\n- What would happen if access was disrupted?\n\n### 2. Explore Norwegian Alternatives\n\nNorwegian colocation options like Green Mountain and the new Skygard facilities offer:\n- Data sovereignty under Norwegian law\n- No CLOUD Act exposure\n- Competitive pricing\n- Renewable energy\n\n### 3. Identify Migration Candidates\n\nLook for workloads that are:\n- Subject to Norwegian data residency requirements\n- Containing sensitive citizen or business data\n- Critical to national infrastructure\n- Stable and predictable (cost-effective to host locally)\n\n### 4. Plan for the Exit Tax\n\nBudget for egress fees, migration tooling, parallel running costs, and potential downtime. The EU Data Act will help after January 2027, but planning ahead reduces surprises.\n\n### 5. Consider Hybrid Sovereignty\n\nYou don't have to choose all-or-nothing. Many organizations are keeping non-sensitive workloads in hyperscaler clouds while moving sensitive data and critical systems to sovereign infrastructure.\n\n## The Path Forward\n\nCloud geopatriation has moved from contrarian position to mainstream strategy. By mid-2025, analysts predict it could become the \"hottest term\" in infrastructure planning, driven by:\n\n- **Sovereignty concerns** - Data residency, legal jurisdiction, and national security\n- **Geopolitical risk** - The changing relationship between Europe and the US\n- **Regulatory pressure** - EU Data Act and national security requirements\n- **Control** - Organizations want to own their infrastructure destiny\n\nThe question for Norwegian organizations is no longer whether to think about sovereignty - it's how quickly to act.\n\nYour data. Your infrastructure. Your choice.\n\n---\n\n## Sources\n\n**Nordic Sources:**\n- [Telenor Skygard Data Center Investment - Telenor Group](https://www.telenor.com/media/newsroom/announcement/telenor-hafslund-and-hitecvision-announces-2-4-billion-nok-investment-in-oslo-data-center/)\n- [Norway's Data Center Builders Focus on Energy Efficiency - Computer Weekly](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366599458/Norways-datacentre-builders-focus-on-energy-efficiency)\n- [Green Mountain Data Centers](https://greenmountain.no/)\n- [Denmark identifies US as security threat - CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/10/europe/denmark-intelligence-report-intl)\n\n**Global Sources:**\n- [Gartner: \"This is geopatriation, not cloud repatriation\"](https://www.channelweb.co.uk/news/2025/geopatriation)\n- [37signals Cloud Exit Savings - The Register](https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/21/37signals_aws_savings/)\n- [Basecamp: Leaving the Cloud](https://basecamp.com/cloud-exit)\n- [Why We're Leaving the Cloud - DHH](https://world.hey.com/dhh/why-we-re-leaving-the-cloud-654b47e0)\n- [Ahrefs On-Prem Savings - The Register](https://www.theregister.com/2023/03/13/ahrefs_on_prem_savings/)\n- [Cloud Migration Costs 2025 - Appinventiv](https://appinventiv.com/blog/cloud-migration-costs/)\n- [The True Cost of Cloud Data Egress - CloudOptimo](https://www.cloudoptimo.com/blog/the-true-cost-of-cloud-data-egress-and-how-to-manage-it/)"

      "body": "Your mother needs a hospital appointment. The booking system runs on Azure. The authentication flows through Okta. The email reminder uses SendGrid. The SMS notification goes via a Norwegian provider, but you know that their service run i a US cloud.\n\nNow imagine the US decides to restrict access to cloud services for European customers. Trade dispute. Sanctions. Political retaliation. It doesn't matter why - what matters is that your mother can't book her appointment.\n\nThis isn't science fiction. This is the architecture we've built.\n\n## The Services That Would Stop\n\nThink about what happens when the big cloud providers become unavailable:\n\n**Healthcare:**\n- Hospital booking systems go dark\n- Patient records become inaccessible\n- Lab results can't be delivered\n- Prescription systems fail\n\n**Municipal services:**\n- Building permit applications stop\n- Kindergarten enrollment freezes\n- Social services can't process cases\n- Property registration halts\n\n**Daily life:**\n- Bank payments may fail\n- Public transport apps stop working\n- Emergency services lose coordination tools\n- Schools can't access learning platforms\n\nThis isn't about inconvenience. It's about whether a nation can function.\n\n## Why Management Can't Fix This\n\nYour CTO sees \"Microsoft Azure\" on the architecture diagram and thinks: \"Enterprise grade. Reliable. Good choice.\"\n\nThey don't see:\n- The Azure Service Bus SDK that only speaks to Azure\n- The Azure Functions triggers that can't run anywhere else\n- The Cosmos DB queries that won't work on PostgreSQL\n- The Application Insights integration baked into every service\n\nManagement approves technology based on vendor reputation, cost projections, and feature lists. They don't understand the bindings. They can't see the lock-in.\n\n**You can.**\n\nYou're the one who writes `using Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus` instead of using AMQP. You're the one who deploys to Azure Functions instead of a container. You're the one who chooses Cosmos DB when PostgreSQL would work.\n\nEvery line of code you write either increases or decreases your nation's dependency on foreign infrastructure.\n\n## The Geopolitical Reality\n\n\"But the USA is our ally! They're the West. Our reliable partners. Our friends.\"\n\nHave you heard about the new sheriff in town? At the Munich Security Conference in February 2025, US Vice President JD Vance [lectured European allies](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2025/02/14/full_speech_vice_president_jd_vance_addresses_munich_security_conference.html) on free speech and democracy, declared \"there is a new sheriff in town,\" and made clear that American interests come first. The speech was so confrontational that one senior European official said Vance \"did something whilst being in Germany that Germans are pretty good at: Teaching lessons to others.\"\n\nThen in December 2025, Denmark's Defense Intelligence Service [identified the United States as a security threat](https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/10/europe/denmark-intelligence-report-intl) for the first time ever. The report warns that the US \"uses economic power, including threats of high tariffs, to enforce its will and no longer rules out the use of military force, even against allies.\" A NATO ally. Calling the US a threat. In an official intelligence assessment.\n\nThe comfortable assumption that \"US services will always be available\" is a relic of a more stable era.\n\nConsider:\n- **CLOUD Act** - US law requires American companies to hand over data to US authorities, regardless of where it's stored\n- **Executive orders** - The EU-US Data Privacy Framework depends on US executive orders that can be revoked\n- **Trade wars** - Technology access has become a tool of foreign policy (ask Huawei)\n- **Political instability** - What happens to service agreements when administrations change?\n- **Military threats** - The US president has refused to rule out military action against Greenland, a territory of our neighboring ally Denmark\n\nNorwegian Minister of Digitalisation Karianne Tung has advised all organizations to have an exit strategy. The EU is investing €180 million in sovereign cloud alternatives. Governments understand the risk.\n\nBut governments don't write code. You do.\n\n## What You Can Do\n\nEvery technical decision is a vote for independence or dependence. Here's how to vote for sovereignty:\n\n### 1. Choose Protocols Over SDKs\n\nInstead of:\n```csharp\n// Locked to Azure\nusing Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus;\nvar client = new ServiceBusClient(connectionString);\n```\n\nConsider:\n```csharp\n// Works with any AMQP broker\nusing Amqp;\nvar connection = new Connection(address);\n```\n\nOr better - use an abstraction like Dapr that lets you switch backends without code changes.\n\n### 2. Containerize Instead of Going Serverless\n\nAzure Functions, AWS Lambda, and Google Cloud Functions are convenient. They're also prisons.\n\nA containerized workload runs anywhere: Azure, AWS, on-premise, or a Norwegian data center. The 30 minutes you spend writing a Dockerfile buys your nation independence.\n\n### 3. Use OpenTelemetry, Not Vendor APM\n\nInstead of:\n```csharp\n// Locked to Azure\nusing Microsoft.ApplicationInsights;\nvar telemetry = new TelemetryClient();\n```\n\nUse:\n```csharp\n// Works everywhere\nusing OpenTelemetry;\nvar tracer = TracerProvider.Default.GetTracer(\"MyService\");\n```\n\nOpenTelemetry sends data to any backend - Jaeger, Prometheus, Grafana, or yes, even Application Insights if you choose.\n\n### 4. Pick Boring Databases\n\nCosmos DB is impressive. It's also only available on Azure.\n\nPostgreSQL runs everywhere. It's battle-tested, well-understood, and supported by every cloud provider and on-premise setup. When the choice doesn't matter for your use case, choose the portable option.\n\n### 5. Question Every Managed Service\n\nBefore using a cloud-specific service, ask:\n- What happens if we need to run this elsewhere?\n- Is there a standard protocol or open-source alternative?\n- Am I choosing this because it's better, or because it's easier right now?\n\n\"Easier right now\" is how nations lose their digital independence.\n\n## The Conversation You Need to Have\n\nNext time you're in an architecture review, ask: \"What's our exit strategy for this service?\"\n\nYou'll get blank stares. That's the point.\n\nPush for:\n- **An approved services list** that prioritizes portable options\n- **Abstraction requirements** for infrastructure dependencies\n- **Regular portability assessments** of critical systems\n\nYour organization probably won't care about national sovereignty. But they might care about:\n- Negotiating leverage with vendors\n- Avoiding surprise migrations when regulations change\n- Not being held hostage on pricing\n\nFrame it however you need to. The result is the same.\n\n## Your Responsibility\n\nSoftware developers have become critical infrastructure workers without most of us realizing it. The code you write today determines whether essential services function tomorrow.\n\nYou have knowledge that your managers, your executives, and your politicians don't have. You understand what it means when a system is built on proprietary foundations. You can see the dependencies that others can't.\n\nThat knowledge comes with responsibility.\n\nThe next time you reach for a vendor SDK instead of an open standard, remember: you're not just making a technical choice. You're making a choice about whether your country can function independently.\n\nYour mother's hospital appointment might depend on it.\n\n---\n\n## What To Do Monday Morning\n\n1. **Audit one service** - Pick a system you work on. List its cloud dependencies. Could it run elsewhere?\n\n2. **Propose one change** - Find one place where a proprietary SDK could be replaced with a standard protocol.\n\n3. **Start the conversation** - Ask your team: \"Do we have an exit strategy?\"\n\n4. **Learn Dapr** - It takes a few hours to understand. It could save months of migration work.\n\n5. **Document dependencies** - Create visibility. You can't fix what you can't see.\n\nSmall steps. Big impact. Your nation is counting on you - they just don't know it yet.\n\n---\n\n## Further Reading\n\n**On Digital Sovereignty:**\n- [What is Digital Sovereignty and How Are Countries Approaching It?](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/01/europe-digital-sovereignty/) - World Economic Forum overview of the sovereignty landscape\n- [Reclaiming Europe's Digital Sovereignty](https://www.noemamag.com/reclaiming-europes-digital-sovereignty/) - NOEMA Magazine on strategic independence\n- [The State of Digital Sovereignty in Europe 2025](https://wire.com/en/blog/state-digital-sovereignty-europe) - Survey and insights on current state\n- [A Primer on Digital Sovereignty & Open Source](https://www.opensourcerers.org/2021/08/09/a-promer-on-digital-sovereignty/) - How open source enables sovereignty\n\n**On Escaping Vendor Lock-in:**\n- [Open Source: The Key to Achieving Digital Sovereignty](https://www.suse.com/c/open-source-the-key-to-achieving-digital-sovereignty/) - SUSE on open source as the path forward\n- [Sovereignty Through Portability: How to Avoid Vendor Lock-in](https://www.arvato-systems.com/blog/sovereignty-through-portability-how-to-avoid-vendor-lock-in) - Practical portability strategies\n- [Open Source Software: Added Flexibility to Break Free from Vendor Lock-in](https://www.bfh.ch/en/news/stories/2025/open-source-vendor-lock-in/) - Academic perspective on gradual migration\n- [Open Source: A Global Commons to Enable Digital Sovereignty](https://opensource.org/blog/open-source-a-global-commons-to-enable-digital-sovereignty) - Open Source Initiative on the global commons\n\n**On Critical Infrastructure:**\n- [The Danger of Critical Infrastructure Interdependency](https://www.cigionline.org/articles/danger-critical-infrastructure-interdependency/) - Centre for International Governance Innovation on cascading failures\n- [Building Resilient Platforms: Insights from Mission-Critical Infrastructure](https://www.infoq.com/articles/building-resilient-platforms-mission-critical-infrastructure/) - InfoQ on building systems others depend on"

      "body": "In February 2025, the United States [sanctioned the International Criminal Court](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/imposing-sanctions-on-the-international-criminal-court/) - the world's war crimes tribunal. Judges. Prosecutors. Staff. An institution created to hold perpetrators of genocide and crimes against humanity accountable.\n\nThe message was clear: if you pursue justice in ways that conflict with American interests, you will be punished.\n\nBut sanctions aren't just about freezing bank accounts. In a world where organizations run on Microsoft 365, store data in AWS, and communicate through American platforms, sanctions become a digital kill switch.\n\n**What happens when your morals are sanctioned?**\n\n## The ICC: A Warning for Every International Organization\n\nThe [sanctions against the ICC](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/how-sanctions-imposed-by-trump-are-taking-a-toll-on-the-international-criminal-court) didn't just target individuals - they targeted the court's ability to function:\n\n- Nine ICC personnel sanctioned, including six judges and the chief prosecutor\n- Financial institutions globally began refusing transactions with the ICC\n- US threatened to pressure allies to withdraw cooperation\n- Social media accounts restricted\n- The court's ability to investigate war crimes compromised\n\nFrance [condemned the sanctions](https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/12/01/international-criminal-court-justice-at-risk) as a \"flagrant attack on the independence of an impartial judicial institution.\" But condemnation doesn't restore banking access.\n\nThe ICC discovered a hard truth: **digital dependency is political vulnerability**.\n\n## The Pattern: Who Else Has Been Targeted?\n\nThe ICC isn't alone. The Trump administration has systematically targeted organizations that challenge American or allied interests:\n\n**Palestinian human rights organizations** - [sanctioned in September 2025](https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/09/04/us-uses-icc-sanctions-against-three-leading-palestinian-rights-groups) under the same executive order as the ICC:\n- Al-Haq (founded 1979, pioneering human rights documentation)\n- Al Mezan Center for Human Rights (two decades documenting laws of war violations)\n- Palestinian Centre for Human Rights (providing legal aid to victims)\n\nTheir crime? Providing evidence to the International Criminal Court.\n\n**UN officials:**\n- [Francesca Albanese](https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/07/10/us-imposes-sanctions-on-un-special-rapporteur), UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in the Palestinian Territory - sanctioned in July 2025 for writing reports critical of Israeli actions\n\n**UNRWA** (UN agency for Palestinian refugees):\n- [Terrorism-related sanctions under consideration](https://www.timesofisrael.com/us-considers-hitting-unrwa-with-terrorism-related-sanctions/) - would be unprecedented sanctions against a UN body\n\n**The entire humanitarian aid sector:**\n- USAID [effectively eliminated](https://www.oxfamamerica.org/explore/issues/making-foreign-aid-work/what-do-trumps-proposed-foreign-aid-cuts-mean/) - 86% of programs terminated\n- 42% of global humanitarian funding withdrawn\n- [14 million projected deaths](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01186-9/fulltext) from aid cuts by 2030 (Lancet study)\n\nThe pattern is clear: organizations that stand for justice, human rights, or humanitarian principles that conflict with US policy are being systematically defunded, sanctioned, or both.\n\n## Who's Next?\n\nIf you work for an organization that:\n- Advocates for human rights\n- Documents war crimes or human rights violations\n- Provides humanitarian aid in contested regions\n- Challenges the policies of the US or its allies\n- Supports refugees or displaced populations\n- Works on climate justice\n- Investigates corporate wrongdoing by American companies\n\n**You should be asking: what happens to our digital infrastructure if we're targeted?**\n\nConsider:\n- Your Microsoft 365 tenant - controlled by a US company\n- Your AWS or Azure hosting - subject to US law\n- Your Slack or Teams communications - stored on US servers\n- Your payment processing - flowing through US-dominated systems\n- Your email - probably Gmail or Outlook\n\nA single executive order could turn off your organization's ability to operate.\n\n## The Norwegian Red Cross Question\n\nImagine a scenario: A Norwegian humanitarian organization provides aid in a region where US policy conflicts with humanitarian principles. Perhaps they treat wounded civilians on \"the wrong side.\" Perhaps they document war crimes by US allies. Perhaps they simply refuse to discriminate based on American political preferences.\n\nCould they be sanctioned? After the ICC, the answer is clearly yes.\n\nAnd if they run on Microsoft 365 and Azure - as many Norwegian organizations do - what then?\n\nThis isn't hypothetical fear-mongering. The ICC is a respected international institution with broad global support. If they can be sanctioned, any organization can be.\n\n## We Can't Have Our Morals Sanctioned\n\nNorwegian organizations - whether humanitarian, human rights, environmental, or civil society - need to ask themselves a fundamental question:\n\n**Should our ability to act on our values depend on American approval?**\n\nIf the answer is no, then digital sovereignty isn't a technical preference. It's a moral imperative.\n\nOrganizations doing difficult, principled work need infrastructure that can't be switched off from Washington:\n- Email and collaboration on European platforms\n- Data stored under European jurisdiction\n- Communication tools outside US control\n- Payment systems that don't flow through US-dominated networks\n\nThis isn't about being anti-American. Good, trusted friends tell each other what they mean, even when it's uncomfortable. But a person who dictates what you can think and do, who punishes you for acting on your conscience. Can that person really be your friend?\n\nIt's about maintaining the ability to act according to your own conscience, your own values, and your own nation's laws - regardless of who sits in the White House.\n\n## What Organizations Should Do Now\n\n### 1. Assess Your Exposure\n\nMap your digital infrastructure:\n- Where is your data stored?\n- Which services depend on US companies?\n- What would happen if your Microsoft tenant was suspended?\n- Could you continue operating if US services were cut off?\n\n### 2. Identify Critical Systems\n\nNot everything needs to move. Focus on:\n- Communications (email, messaging)\n- Document storage and collaboration\n- Donor and financial systems\n- Case management and operational data\n\n### 3. Explore European Alternatives\n\nSovereign options exist:\n- Email: Proton Mail (Switzerland), Tutanota (Germany)\n- Collaboration: Nextcloud (Germany), CryptPad (France)\n- Cloud: Hetzner (Germany), Scaleway (France), Green Mountain (Norway)\n- Video: Jitsi (open source), Element/Matrix (decentralized)\n\n### 4. Plan for Independence\n\nCreate a transition plan:\n- What would you migrate first in an emergency?\n- Who has the technical skills to execute a rapid move?\n- Have you tested your backup and recovery capabilities?\n\n### 5. Advocate for Sector-Wide Change\n\nIndividual organizations can't solve this alone. Push for:\n- Sector-wide digital sovereignty standards\n- Shared infrastructure for humanitarian organizations\n- Government support for sovereign alternatives\n- Recognition that digital independence is operational security\n\n## The Moral Case for Digital Sovereignty\n\nThe ICC sanctions aren't primarily a technology story. They're a story about power - about who gets to decide what justice means, which lives matter, and which organizations deserve to exist.\n\nBut technology is the mechanism through which that power is exercised.\n\nEvery organization that runs on American infrastructure has implicitly accepted that their ability to operate depends on American goodwill. For many organizations, that's an acceptable trade-off - American cloud services are excellent, affordable, and convenient.\n\nBut for organizations whose mission might someday conflict with American interests - organizations fighting for human rights, documenting inconvenient truths, providing aid to unpopular populations, or simply following international law when America chooses not to - that dependency is existential risk.\n\n**We cannot let our ability to do what's right depend on someone else's permission.**\n\nDigital sovereignty isn't about nationalism or technology preferences. It's about maintaining the independence to act according to your values, even when powerful actors disagree.\n\nThe ICC thought they were protected by international law and global legitimacy. They weren't.\n\nDon't make the same assumption about your cloud provider.\n\n---\n\n## Sources\n\n**ICC Sanctions:**\n- [Executive Order: Imposing Sanctions on the International Criminal Court - White House](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/imposing-sanctions-on-the-international-criminal-court/)\n- [How sanctions are taking a toll on the ICC - PBS](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/how-sanctions-imposed-by-trump-are-taking-a-toll-on-the-international-criminal-court)\n- [International Criminal Court: Justice at Risk - Human Rights Watch](https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/12/01/international-criminal-court-justice-at-risk)\n- [What do the Trump administration's sanctions on the ICC mean for justice and human rights? - Amnesty International](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2025/03/what-do-the-trump-administrations-sanctions-on-the-icc-mean-for-justice-and-human-rights/)\n- [Trump's Pressure Campaign Against the ICC - Foreign Policy](https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/12/10/trump-icc-sanctions-hegseth-war-crimes/)\n\n**Palestinian Human Rights Organizations:**\n- [US Uses ICC Sanctions Against Three Leading Palestinian Rights Groups - Human Rights Watch](https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/09/04/us-uses-icc-sanctions-against-three-leading-palestinian-rights-groups)\n- [UN experts dismayed by US sanctions against Palestinian human rights organisations - OHCHR](https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2025/09/un-experts-dismayed-us-sanctions-against-palestinian-human-rights)\n- [US sanctions Palestinian rights groups for supporting ICC Israel probe - Al Jazeera](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/9/4/us-sanctions-palestinian-rights-groups-for-supporting-icc-israel-probe)\n\n**UN Special Rapporteur:**\n- [US Imposes Sanctions on UN Special Rapporteur - Human Rights Watch](https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/07/10/us-imposes-sanctions-on-un-special-rapporteur)\n- [UN calls for reversal of US sanctions on Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese - UN News](https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/07/1165359)\n- [USA: Sanctions against UN Special Rapporteur are a disgraceful affront to international justice - Amnesty International](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2025/07/usa-sanctions-against-un-special-rapporteur-francesca-albanese-are-a-disgraceful-affront-to-international-justice/)\n\n**UNRWA:**\n- [US considers hitting UNRWA with terrorism-related sanctions - Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/us-considers-hitting-unrwa-with-terrorism-related-sanctions/)\n- [Trump admin weighs terrorism sanctions against UN agency UNRWA - Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-admin-weighs-terrorism-sanctions-against-un-palestinian-aid-agency-over-hamas-allegations)\n\n**Humanitarian Aid Cuts:**\n- [Trump's aid cuts plunge humanitarian sector into existential crisis - SwissInfo](https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/international-geneva/trumps-aid-cuts-plunge-humanitarian-sector-into-existential-crisis/89278455)\n- [Impact of USAID cuts on global humanitarian aid - Oxfam](https://www.oxfamamerica.org/explore/issues/making-foreign-aid-work/what-do-trumps-proposed-foreign-aid-cuts-mean/)\n- [Projected deaths from USAID funding cuts - The Lancet](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01186-9/fulltext)"

Your documents, your emails, your family photos - increasingly stored on Microsoft servers, accessed through Microsoft accounts.\n\n**Accounts can be suspended.** Microsoft's terms of service give them broad authority to suspend accounts. And as we've seen with the [US sanctions against the International Criminal Court](/blog/2025-12-11-digital-sovereignty-moral-independence/) - the world's war crimes tribunal - when the US government wants to cut off access to services, American companies comply.\n\n### Ask the Iranians\n\nPeople in sanctioned countries know exactly what this looks like. In Iran, Cuba, Syria, and other sanctioned nations:\n\n- Microsoft accounts are blocked or restricted\n- Google services are unavailable or limited\n- GitHub access is restricted for developers\n- Cloud services refuse to serve users based on location\n- Payment systems don't work\n\nIranian developers have [written extensively](https://dev.to/hamed/my-life-as-a-developer-in-iran-under-us-sanctions-2bkp) about being locked out of GitHub, losing access to their own code repositories, and being cut off from the tools the rest of the world takes for granted.\n\nThese aren't criminals. They're ordinary people trying to do their jobs. Their \"crime\" is living in the wrong country.\n\n**The sanctions don't distinguish between governments and citizens.**\n\n## Insurance You Buy Before the Fire\n\nYou don't buy house insurance when your house is already burning. You buy it before, hoping you'll never need it.\n\nDigital insurance works the same way. The time to prepare for being locked out is before it happens. The insurance policy? **Open standards.**\n\nOpen standards mean:\n- Your documents work in multiple programs, not just one vendor's\n- Your data can be exported and moved elsewhere\n- Your tools can be replaced without losing your work\n- No single company can lock you out of your own files\n\n## The Burden of Change\n\nHere's the honest truth: switching tools is hard.\n\nWe all have workflows built around specific software. Muscle memory for keyboard shortcuts. Templates and macros we've refined over years. The thought of changing all of that is exhausting.\n\nNow imagine this: you don't choose to change! You're forced to. Overnight. Everything different. No preparation. No gradual learning. Just sudden, complete disruption.\n\nThat's what happens when you get locked out.\n\nThe burden of changing one tool at a time, on your own schedule, learning as you go - that's manageable. The burden of changing everything at once because you have no choice - that's catastrophic.\n\n**Which burden would you rather carry?**\n\n## Three Choices\n\nWhen the lockout comes, you have three options:\n\n**1. Give in to the ransom**\n\nComply with whatever demands are made. Change your behavior, your speech, your affiliations to satisfy whoever holds the key. Abandon your principles to regain access.\n\n**2. Change everything overnight**\n\nScramble to find alternatives for every tool you use. Lose access to your history, your files, your carefully built systems. Start from zero, under pressure, with no preparation.\n\n**3. Change tools over time (starting now)**\n\nBegin transitioning to open standards and alternative tools while you still have access to everything. Export your data. Learn new software gradually. Build redundancy. Create your insurance policy before you need it.\n\nOnly one of these options is really a choice. The other two are surrenders.\n\n## Where to Start\n\nYou don't have to change everything at once. Start with the most critical areas:\n\n### Documents and Office Work\n\n**Instead of:** Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, PowerPoint)\n**Consider:** LibreOffice (free, open source, reads/writes Microsoft formats)\n\nLibreOffice isn't identical to Microsoft Office - but it handles most common tasks well, and your documents remain yours. Export your important documents to open formats (.odt, .ods) as backup.\n\n### Email\n\n**Instead of:** Outlook.com, Gmail\n**Consider:** ProtonMail (Switzerland), Tutanota (Germany), or self-hosted options\n\nAt minimum, ensure you can export your email and have a backup email address on a different provider.\n\n### Cloud Storage\n\n**Instead of:** OneDrive, Google Drive\n**Consider:** Nextcloud (can self-host or use European providers), Tresorit (Switzerland)\n\nThe key isn't necessarily moving everything - it's having copies of critical files somewhere you control.\n\n### Operating System\n\n**Instead of:** Windows with mandatory Microsoft account\n**Consider:** Linux (Ubuntu, Fedora, Linux Mint for beginners)\n\nThis is the biggest change, but also the most complete insurance. Linux doesn't require anyone's permission to use.\n\n### Photos and Memories\n\n**Critical:** Ensure your family photos exist somewhere other than OneDrive/iCloud/Google Photos. Local backup. Multiple copies. These are irreplaceable.\n\n## The Interoperability Bonus\n\nHere's something interesting: when you use open standards, interoperability often gets better, not worse.\n\nA document saved in Open Document Format (.odt) can be opened by LibreOffice, Microsoft Office, Google Docs, and many other programs. A document saved in a proprietary format might only work properly in one.\n\nOpen standards were designed for interoperability. Proprietary formats were designed for lock-in.\n\nWhen everyone uses standards, everyone can communicate. When everyone uses one vendor's formats, everyone depends on that vendor's goodwill.\n\n## How You Contribute to National Sovereignty\n\nThis isn't just about protecting yourself. Every choice you make shapes Norway's digital independence.\n\n**When you choose open standards:**\n- You create demand for sovereign alternatives\n- You build skills that don't depend on foreign vendors\n- You make it easier for colleagues, friends, and family to follow\n- You reduce Norway's collective vulnerability to foreign pressure\n\n**When you stay with proprietary systems:**\n- You deepen the dependency\n- You make it harder for alternatives to survive\n- You accept that Norwegian data flows through foreign hands\n- You vote with your wallet for lock-in\n\nNorwegian Minister of Digitalization Karianne Tung has called for [exit strategies from foreign cloud providers](/blog/2025-12-01-norway-exit-strategy/). But government policy alone can't create digital sovereignty. It requires citizens and organizations making different choices.\n\nEvery LibreOffice installation, every ProtonMail account, every Nextcloud server is a small act of sovereignty. Individually, they're personal insurance. Collectively, they're national infrastructure.\n\n**Your digital choices are political choices** - whether you make them consciously or not.\n\n## What About Your Work?\n\nYour personal computer is one thing. But what about your job?\n\nIf you work for a company that uses Microsoft 365, your work email, your documents, your Teams conversations, your SharePoint files - all of it lives on Microsoft's servers, accessed through Microsoft accounts.\n\n**Does your employer have a Plan B?**\n\nHas anyone at your workplace ever discussed what happens if your organization loses access to Microsoft services? Not a temporary outage - a permanent lockout?\n\nMost Norwegian organizations have disaster recovery plans. They plan for server failures, natural disasters, cyberattacks, data breaches. How many have planned for: \"Our cloud provider suspends our account\"?\n\nThis isn't in most risk assessments because it seems impossible. But ask the ICC - an international court backed by 124 countries - how impossible seemed before February 2025.\n\nIf your organization does work that might ever conflict with US interests - humanitarian aid, human rights documentation, environmental activism, journalism, international law - the question isn't whether you *should* have a plan. It's whether you can afford not to.\n\n## Why This Dependency Exists\n\nWe didn't end up dependent on American technology by accident. Microsoft created genuinely excellent products. They standardized how we work with documents. They made computers accessible to ordinary people. The productivity gains they enabled are immeasurable.\n\nBut somewhere along the way, a dependency became a vulnerability.\n\n### A Pattern, Not an Accident\n\nThis isn't the first time dominant tech companies have used their position to eliminate choice.\n\nIn the 1990s, Microsoft [bundled Internet Explorer with Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft_Corp.) and used its operating system monopoly to crush Netscape Navigator - then the leading web browser. The US Department of Justice sued, and in 2001, a federal court found Microsoft guilty of maintaining its monopoly through anticompetitive means.\n\nJudge Thomas Penfield Jackson's [findings of fact](https://www.justice.gov/atr/us-v-microsoft-courts-findings-fact) were damning:\n\n> Microsoft has demonstrated that it will use its prodigious market power and immense profits to harm any firm that insists on pursuing initiatives that could intensify competition against one of Microsoft's core products.\n\nThe court found that Microsoft had:\n- Illegally tied Internet Explorer to Windows\n- Threatened PC manufacturers who promoted competing browsers\n- Deliberately made Windows incompatible with competing software\n- Used its dominance to eliminate consumer choice\n\nMicrosoft was nearly broken up. Instead, they settled with restrictions that have long since expired.\n\nBill Gates was CEO throughout this period. The guilty verdict came in April 2000. Gates stepped down as CEO in January 2000 - just months before the ruling - and announced his transition to philanthropy. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which would reshape his public image from monopolist to humanitarian, was founded that same year.\n\nThe timing is worth noting. Today, Gates is remembered primarily as a philanthropist. The antitrust conviction that nearly broke up his company is largely forgotten.\n\n**Three decades later, the pattern continues** - but now the stakes are higher. It's not just your browser. It's your entire digital life, held behind a mandatory account.\n\n## Your Choice\n\nThe question isn't whether the tools we use are good - many of them are excellent. The question is whether you want your ability to use your own computer, access your own files, and do your own work to depend on a foreign corporation's continued permission.\n\nYou have insurance for your house, your car, your health.\n\n**What's your insurance for your digital life?**\n\nThe premium is learning some new tools. The coverage is sovereignty over your own data.\n\nAnd unlike house insurance, this policy only works if you get it before you need it.\n\n---\n\n## Getting Started\n\n**This week:**\n1. Download [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) and open a few of your documents\n2. Export your most important files to open formats\n3. Create a backup email account on a non-US provider\n4. Copy your photos to a local drive\n\n**This month:**\n1. Practice using LibreOffice for some tasks\n2. Export your email archive\n3. Identify which cloud services hold your critical data\n4. Research Linux if you're curious (try it in a virtual machine first)\n\n**This year:**\n1. Gradually shift your primary workflow to open tools\n2. Establish redundant backups for everything important\n3. Reduce your dependency on any single vendor\n4. Help others understand why this matters\n\nSmall steps. Big insurance.\n\n---\n\n## Sources\n\n**Windows 11 Microsoft Account Requirement:**\n- [Microsoft confirms Windows 11 to require Microsoft account, internet during setup - Windows Latest](https://www.windowslatest.com/2025/10/07/microsoft-confirms-windows-11-to-require-microsoft-account-internet-during-oobe-tested/)\n- [Windows 11 Local Account Crackdown: Microsoft Account May Soon Be Mandatory - Android Headlines](https://www.androidheadlines.com/2025/10/windows-11-local-account-crackdown-removal-microsoft-account-mandatory.html)\n- [Microsoft Blocks Online Account Bypass on Windows 11 - TechPowerUp](https://www.techpowerup.com/341656/microsoft-blocks-online-account-bypass-on-windows-11/)\n\n**Microsoft Antitrust Case:**\n- [United States v.

The fastest erosion of security trust in modern Norwegian history.\n\n## The Numbers Don't Lie\n\nAccording to [Opinion's Samfunnsmonitor](https://www.opinion.no/innlegg/okt-krigsfrykt-preger-norge), Norwegian attitudes have shifted dramatically:\n\n**Fear of war in Norway within 5 years** ([TV2, March 2025](https://www.tv2.no/nyheter/innenriks/en-av-seks-nordmenn-tror-det-er-krig-her-innen-fem-ar/17506662/)):\n- February 2024: 6% thought it likely\n- February 2025: 16% think it likely\n\nA near-tripling in one year. As Opinion's senior advisor Nora Clausen [put it](https://www.aftenposten.no/norge/i/Vz2ag1/ny-undersoekelse-hver-sjette-nordmann-tror-det-er-krig-i-norge-innen-fem-aar): \"A few years ago, it would have been unthinkable that every sixth Norwegian expects war in Norway within a few years. Now we're there.\"\n\n**Fear of World War III in their lifetime** ([Norges Forsvarsforening](https://www.forsvarsforeningen.no/nyheter/krigsfrykten-har-okt-blant-nordmenn/)):\n- March 2024: 29% saw great danger\n- February 2025: 42% see great danger\n\n[Nora Clausen commented](https://www.tv2.no/nyheter/innenriks/en-av-seks-nordmenn-tror-det-er-krig-her-innen-fem-ar/17506662/): \"Now there are more Norwegians who believe they will experience World War III than those who don't. The majority of those under 50 believe they will witness a new world war.\"\n\n**Trust in Norway's defense capability** ([Aftenposten, March 2025](https://www.aftenposten.no/norge/i/Vz2ag1/ny-undersoekelse-hver-sjette-nordmann-tror-det-er-krig-i-norge-innen-fem-aar)):\n- February 2025: Only 23% trust it\n- 60% do not trust Norway's ability to defend itself\n\n\"The fact that 60 percent don't believe in Norway's defense capability must be the highest level in my lifetime,\" [says Clausen](https://www.forsvarsforeningen.no/nyheter/krigsfrykten-har-okt-blant-nordmenn/).\n\n## What Changed?\n\nOne name: Donald Trump.\n\nHis re-election in November 2024 and subsequent statements about NATO allies triggered an unprecedented collapse in Norwegian trust. [Opinion's analysis](https://www.aftenposten.no/norge/i/Vz2ag1/ny-undersoekelse-hver-sjette-nordmann-tror-det-er-krig-i-norge-innen-fem-aar) is direct:\n\n> There is little doubt that Donald Trump has made the world a more insecure place. Trust in the USA appears to be eroding at a pace unprecedented in modern history.\n>\n> — Nora Clausen, Opinion\n\nThe [data](https://www.forsvarsforeningen.no/nyheter/krigsfrykten-har-okt-blant-nordmenn/) supports this:\n\n| Month | Trust NATO guarantee |\n|-------|---------------------|\n| March 2024 | 79% |\n| November 2024 | 80% |\n| February 2025 | 47% |\n\nIn just three months after Trump's election, Norway went from overwhelming trust in NATO to barely half the population believing the alliance would protect them.\n\n## Norwegians Are Responding\n\nThis isn't just abstract fear - Norwegians are changing behavior:\n\n**Support for military buildup** ([Norges Forsvarsforening](https://www.forsvarsforeningen.no/nyheter/krigsfrykten-har-okt-blant-nordmenn/)):\n- November 2024: 69% wanted increased defense spending\n- February 2025: 80% want increased defense spending\n\n**Personal preparedness** ([DSB Egenberedskapsundersøkelse 2024](https://www.dsb.no/nyhetsarkiv/2025/brosjyren-om-egenberedskap-ble-lest-og-fulgt-opp)):\n- 2017: 21% stored drinking water\n- 2024: 47% store drinking water\n\nIn May 2024, [DSB increased the recommended personal preparedness](https://www.dsb.no/rad-til-befolkningen/egenberedskap/) from 3 days to 7 days. \"Beredskapsvenn\" (preparedness friend) was named [Norway's word of the year 2024 by Språkrådet](https://sprakradet.no/aktuelt/beredskapsvenn-er-arets-ord/) - a person you have an agreement with for help in a crisis situation.\n\n## The Question No One Is Asking\n\nNorwegians are stockpiling water, extending their preparedness supplies, and supporting military investment. The government is increasing defense budgets.\n\nBut here's what almost no one is discussing:\n\n**If we can no longer rely on American security guarantees, can we rely on American digital infrastructure?**\n\nConsider what Norway runs on:\n- Microsoft 365 for government and business\n- Azure for cloud infrastructure\n- American platforms for communication\n- US-controlled systems for critical services\n\nThe same country whose security commitment we now question controls the digital infrastructure that runs our society.\n\n## The Disconnect: Rising Dependency, Falling Trust\n\nHere's the data that should alarm every Norwegian decision-maker:\n\n{{< mermaid >}}\nxychart-beta\n    x-axis [2014, 2017, 2021, 2023, \"Mar 2024\", \"Nov 2024\", \"Feb 2025\"]\n    y-axis \"Percentage\" 0 --> 100\n    bar [29, 48, 64, 71, 73, 75, 78]\n    line [80, 80, 80, 80, 79, 80, 47]\n    line [3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 10, 16]\n    line [21, 21, 30, 40, 45, 47, 47]\n{{< /mermaid >}}\n\n**Legend:**\n| Color | Metric | Trend | Source |\n|-------|--------|-------|--------|\n| ▓ Bars (peach) | Cloud adoption | 29% → 78% ↑ | SSB/Eurostat |\n| ━ Line 1 (yellow) | NATO trust | 80% → 47% ↓ | Opinion |\n| ━ Line 2 (orange) | Expect war in Norway | 3% → 16% ↑ | Opinion |\n| ━ Line 3 (red) | Households storing water | 21% → 47% ↑ | DSB |\n\n**Norwegian enterprise cloud adoption** ([SSB](https://www.ssb.no/en/teknologi-og-innovasjon/artikler-og-publikasjoner/half-of-norwegian-enterprises-are-buying-cloud-services), [Eurostat](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Cloud_computing_-_statistics_on_the_use_by_enterprises)):\n\n| Year | Enterprises using cloud services |\n|------|----------------------------------|\n| 2014 | 29% |\n| 2017 | 48% |\n| 2021 | 64% |\n| 2023 | 71% |\n\n**Trust in American security guarantee** (Opinion Samfunnsmonitor):\n\n| Date | Trust in NATO |\n|------|---------------|\n| March 2024 | 79% |\n| November 2024 | 80% |\n| February 2025 | 47% |\n\n**The picture is stark:** Cloud dependency climbs steadily upward while trust in the US collapses.\n\nAnd who controls the cloud? [Microsoft holds 63% of the Norwegian cloud market](https://www.stortinget.no/globalassets/pdf/dokumentserien/2024-2025/dok15-202425-2503-vedlegg.pdf). Amazon and Google split another 18%. That's **81% of Norway's cloud infrastructure controlled by American companies** subject to the CLOUD Act - which requires them to hand over data to US authorities regardless of where it's stored.\n\n**96% of Norwegian state agencies** now use cloud services. Public sector cloud spending has [doubled since 2020](https://www.stortinget.no/globalassets/pdf/dokumentserien/2024-2025/dok15-202425-2503-vedlegg.pdf) to an estimated NOK 20 billion annually.\n\nWe're not just dependent. We're becoming *more* dependent, even as trust evaporates.\n\n## The Parallel Is Exact\n\nThe logic Norwegians apply to military security should apply equally to digital security:\n\n**Military dependency:** We assumed NATO (meaning primarily the US) would always protect us. That assumption is now in doubt.\n\n**Digital dependency:** We assume American tech companies will always serve us. Why is that assumption safer?\n\nIn both cases:\n- We outsourced critical capability to the United States\n- We assumed American interests would align with ours\n- We're now discovering that assumption may be wrong\n\nDefense Minister Tore O. Sandvik [acknowledged](https://www.regjeringen.no) in 2025: \"We face an unsettled and demanding security situation.\"\n\nThe same is true digitally - we just haven't admitted it yet.\n\n## How Fast Support Can Be Withdrawn\n\nIn March 2025, Norwegians witnessed in real-time how quickly American support can be weaponized.\n\nAfter a heated Oval Office argument on February 28, the Trump administration:\n\n**March 3, 2025:** [Paused all military aid to Ukraine](https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/03/politics/trump-administration-ukraine-aid) - stopping shipments of weapons and equipment not yet inside the country.\n\n**March 5, 2025:** [Paused intelligence sharing](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/03/05/us-ukraine-intelligence-sharing/) - cutting off the targeting information Ukraine needed to defend itself.\n\nOne source familiar with the arrangement told [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/ukraine-trump-intelligence-sharing-russia-putin-war-kyiv-zelenskyy-rcna194907): *\"Combined with the stopping of military assistance and foreign aid, it pretty much guarantees a Russian victory without there needing to be a peace deal.\"*\n\nBoth were [restored only after Ukraine agreed](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/ukraine-us-restart-intelligence-sharing-security-assistance-rcna195891) to accept Trump's ceasefire proposal terms.\n\n**The lesson:** A nation's ability to defend itself was switched off - and back on - based on one leader's mood after a single meeting. This is the reality of dependency.\n\nNow ask yourself: If American military support can be paused with a phone call, what about American digital services?\n\n## What Sanctions Teach Us\n\nWhile Norway debates military preparedness, other countries are already experiencing digital lockout.\n\nWhen the US [sanctioned the International Criminal Court](/blog/2025-12-11-digital-sovereignty-moral-independence/) in February 2025, it demonstrated that even international institutions backed by 124 countries can be cut off from digital services.\n\nIranian developers have [written extensively](https://dev.to/hamed/my-life-as-a-developer-in-iran-under-us-sanctions-2bkp) about losing access to GitHub, cloud services, and the tools the rest of the world takes for granted.\n\nThe mechanism exists. The precedent is set. The only question is whether Norway will ever be on the receiving end.\n\n## 80% Want Defense Investment - What About Digital Defense?\n\nThe [Opinion survey](https://www.tv2.no/nyheter/innenriks/en-av-seks-nordmenn-tror-det-er-krig-her-innen-fem-ar/17506662/) shows 80% of Norwegians support increased defense spending. This makes sense - when you realize a threat is real, you invest in protection.\n\nBut digital sovereignty is also defense. It's defending:\n- Our data from foreign access\n- Our services from arbitrary suspension\n- Our economy from external control\n- Our democracy from digital coercion\n\nNorwegian Minister of Digitalization Karianne Tung has called for [exit strategies from foreign cloud providers](/blog/2025-12-01-norway-exit-strategy/). But this message hasn't penetrated public consciousness the way military preparedness has.\n\n## The Word of the Year Should Be \"Digital Sovereignty\"\n\n\"Beredskapsvenn\" won word of the year because Norwegians understood they need to prepare for crisis together.\n\nThe same logic applies digitally:\n- Personal preparedness: [Use open standards, diversify your tools](/blog/2025-12-12-take-control-digital-sovereignty/)\n- Organizational preparedness: Have exit strategies, European alternatives\n- National preparedness: Invest in sovereign infrastructure\n\nIf 80% of Norwegians support military investment because they no longer trust American guarantees, shouldn't they also support digital sovereignty for the same reason?\n\n## The Trust Equation\n\nHere's the uncomfortable truth:\n\n| Domain | Trust in US (Feb 2025) |\n|--------|----------------------|\n| Military protection | 47% |\n| Digital services | ? |\n\nWe've measured the first number. We haven't honestly confronted the second.\n\nBut the same administration that's causing Norwegians to doubt NATO is the same administration that [sanctioned the ICC](/blog/2025-12-11-digital-sovereignty-moral-independence/), [threatened humanitarian organizations](/blog/2025-12-11-digital-sovereignty-moral-independence/), and demonstrated that American services can be weaponized against anyone who crosses American interests.\n\n## What Would Preparedness Look Like?\n\nIf Norwegians are stockpiling water and making \"beredskapsvenn\" agreements, what's the digital equivalent?\n\n**Personal level:**\n- Backup email on European provider\n- Important documents in open formats\n- Family photos stored locally\n- Familiarity with alternative tools\n\n**Organizational level:**\n- Data export capabilities tested\n- European alternatives identified\n- Transition plans documented\n- Staff trained on backups\n\n**National level:**\n- Investment in Norwegian/European infrastructure\n- Requirements for data sovereignty in public contracts\n- Support for open source alternatives\n- Digital independence as security policy\n\n## The Same Fear, Different Domain\n\nPRIO director Nina Græger [summarized the mood](https://www.document.no/2025/08/05/undersokelse-okende-krigsfrykt-blant-nordmenn/): \"A growing unease about the future is making itself felt among Norwegians. These findings show a population that increasingly notices an unstable world and is skeptical of institutions' ability to handle this.\"\n\nThat skepticism should extend to digital institutions too.\n\nDefense Chief Eirik Kristoffersen [advised](https://www.dagsavisen.no/nyheter/innenriks/2024/02/13/forsvarssjefen-tror-ikke-det-er-fare-for-krig-i-norge/): \"My overall message is that we must remain calm, trust our authorities, and above all stand together.\"\n\nStanding together also means building digital infrastructure we control together - not depending on foreign corporations whose loyalties lie elsewhere.\n\n## 61 Conflicts, 91 Autocracies\n\nThe global context reinforces the urgency:\n\n- 2024 saw [61 armed conflicts](https://ucdp.uu.se/) - a record since 1946 ([UCDP/PRIO](https://ucdp.uu.se/))\n- [72% of the world's population](https://www.v-dem.net/documents/44/v-dem_dr2025_highres.pdf) now lives in autocracies ([V-Dem Institute 2025](https://www.v-dem.net/))\n- For the first time in 20+ years, [autocracies outnumber democracies](https://www.v-dem.net/documents/44/v-dem_dr2025_highres.pdf) (91 vs 88)\n\nThis is not a world where we can assume benevolent American protection - military or digital.\n\n## Your Move\n\n47% of Norwegians no longer trust the NATO guarantee.\n\nDo you trust the Microsoft guarantee? The Google guarantee? The Amazon guarantee?\n\nIf not, what are you doing about it?\n\nThe same pragmatic, non-panicked preparedness that's driving Norwegians to store water and support defense spending should drive us toward digital sovereignty.\n\n**Find your digital \"beredskapsvenn.\"** Whether that's LibreOffice, ProtonMail, Nextcloud, or a local backup drive - start building your independence today.\n\nBecause the trust that held for 75 years can collapse in three months.\n\nDon't wait until you're locked out to discover you needed a key.\n\n---\n\n## Sources\n\n**Norwegian Surveys (Opinion Samfunnsmonitor February 2025):**\n- [Opinion: Økt krigsfrykt preger Norge](https://www.opinion.no/innlegg/okt-krigsfrykt-preger-norge) - Primary source\n- [TV2: Én av seks nordmenn tror det er krig her innen fem år](https://www.tv2.no/nyheter/innenriks/en-av-seks-nordmenn-tror-det-er-krig-her-innen-fem-ar/17506662/) - Survey coverage\n- [Aftenposten: Hver sjette nordmann tror det er krig i Norge innen fem år](https://www.aftenposten.no/norge/i/Vz2ag1/ny-undersoekelse-hver-sjette-nordmann-tror-det-er-krig-i-norge-innen-fem-aar) - Survey coverage\n- [Norges Forsvarsforening: Krigsfrykten har økt blant nordmenn](https://www.forsvarsforeningen.no/nyheter/krigsfrykten-har-okt-blant-nordmenn/) - Survey analysis\n- [Document.no: Økende krigsfrykt blant nordmenn](https://www.document.no/2025/08/05/undersokelse-okende-krigsfrykt-blant-nordmenn/) - PRIO survey coverage\n\n**Preparedness:**\n- [DSB: Brosjyren om egenberedskap ble lest og fulgt opp](https://www.dsb.no/nyhetsarkiv/2025/brosjyren-om-egenberedskap-ble-lest-og-fulgt-opp) - Preparedness statistics\n- [DSB Egenberedskap](https://www.dsb.no/rad-til-befolkningen/egenberedskap/) - 7-day preparedness recommendation\n- [Språkrådet: Beredskapsvenn er årets ord](https://sprakradet.no/aktuelt/beredskapsvenn-er-arets-ord/) - Word of the year 2024\n\n**Cloud Adoption Statistics:**\n- [SSB: Half of Norwegian enterprises buying cloud services](https://www.ssb.no/en/teknologi-og-innovasjon/artikler-og-publikasjoner/half-of-norwegian-enterprises-are-buying-cloud-services) - Enterprise cloud adoption 2014-2017\n- [Eurostat: Cloud computing statistics](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Cloud_computing_-_statistics_on_the_use_by_enterprises) - Enterprise cloud adoption 2021-2023\n- [Stortinget: Markedet for skytjenester](https://www.stortinget.no/globalassets/pdf/dokumentserien/2024-2025/dok15-202425-2503-vedlegg.pdf) - Market share and public sector spending\n\n**Global Context:**\n- [Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP)](https://ucdp.uu.se) - Global conflict statistics\n- [V-Dem Institute Democracy Report 2025](https://www.v-dem.net/documents/44/v-dem_dr2025_highres.pdf) - Democracy tracking\n\n**Official Statements:**\n- [Dagsavisen: Forsvarssjefen tror ikke det er fare for krig i Norge](https://www.dagsavisen.no/nyheter/innenriks/2024/02/13/forsvarssjefen-tror-ikke-det-er-fare-for-krig-i-norge/) - Defense Chief statement\n\n**Related Articles:**\n- [When Your Values Become a Liability: Digital Sovereignty and Moral Independence](/blog/2025-12-11-digital-sovereignty-moral-independence/)\n- [Take Control: How You Can Protect Your Digital Life and Help Norway Stay Sovereign](/blog/2025-12-12-take-control-digital-sovereignty/)\n- [Minister Tung's Exit Strategy Call](/blog/2025-12-01-norway-exit-strategy/)"

      "body": "In September 2024, Norway's telecommunications authority Nkom made an extraordinary announcement: they would [stop tracking GPS jamming incidents in Finnmark](https://www.thebarentsobserver.com).\n\nNot because the jamming stopped. Because it became *so constant* that tracking it was pointless.\n\nWelcome to the new normal.\n\n## The Numbers Are Staggering\n\n**GPS jamming in Finnmark** ([Nkom](https://www.nkom.no)):\n\n| Year | Days with GPS jamming |\n|------|----------------------|\n| 2021 | 18 days |\n| 2022 | 122 days |\n| 2023 | 294 days |\n| 2024 | Almost every day |\n\nFrom 18 days to 294 days in two years. That's not an anomaly - that's electronic warfare.\n\n[Nkom has confirmed through helicopter measurements](https://www.thebarentsobserver.com) that the interference originates from Russian territory, where Russia's Northern Fleet operates electronic warfare units near Severomorsk and in the Pechenga region bordering Norway and Finland.\n\n## Real Consequences for Real People\n\nThis isn't abstract. The jamming affects:\n\n- **[Widerøe flights](https://www.highnorthnews.com)** forced to abort landings (most recently in Vardø, September 2025)\n- **SAS and Norwegian** flights disrupted\n- **Air ambulances** unable to operate normally\n- **Police search and rescue** operations hampered\n- **Ambulances, fire trucks, civil defense** - all affected\n\n*\"We are extremely concerned about such GPS jamming. Unfortunately, it is nothing new here in Eastern Finnmark,\"* said [Catharina Solli from Widerøe](https://www.highnorthnews.com) in September 2025.\n\nPolice Inspector Trond Eirik Nilsen explained the stakes: *\"We are dependent on good GPS signals to quickly locate areas with missing persons in extreme weather.\"*\n\nAffected airports include Kirkenes (55 km from the Russian border), Vardø, Vadsø, Båtsfjord, Berlevåg, Mehamn, Lakselv, and Alta.\n\n## 40 Sabotage Operations in One Year\n\nGPS jamming is just one front. According to [E-tjenesten's FOKUS 2025 report](https://www.etterretningstjenesten.no/publikasjoner/fokus/fokus2025_innhold), there were **40 confirmed or planned Russian sabotage operations across Europe in 2024**.\n\nIntelligence Chief Nils Andreas Stensønes was blunt: *\"Since we presented this last year, the world has become more dangerous.\"*\n\nAnd: *\"Russia considers itself in direct conflict with the West. This will persist regardless of the outcome of the war in Ukraine.\"*\n\n## A Norwegian Dam - Hacked\n\nIn April 2025, the hybrid war reached Norwegian critical infrastructure directly.\n\n**The Risevatnet dam in Bremanger** was [hacked by pro-Russian actors](https://www.pst.no):\n\n- Attackers took control of the dam system\n- Opened the water valve to 100% capacity\n- Released approximately 7.2 million liters over 4 hours\n- The breach wasn't detected for 4 hours\n\nThe cause? A weak password on an internet-exposed control panel. No multi-factor authentication.\n\nPST Chief Beate Gangås [confirmed in August 2025](https://www.pst.no/alle-artikler/artikler/sjefens-forord-ntv-2025/): *\"Over the past year, we have seen a change in the activity of pro-Russian cyber actors. In April, a dam in Western Norway became the target of such an operation.\"*\n\nShe explained the purpose: *\"They don't necessarily want to spread destruction, but to show what they are capable of. The purpose of this type of action is to contribute to influence and create fear or unease among the country's population.\"*\n\nThis was the **first confirmed Russian sabotage against European dam infrastructure**.\n\n## Norwegian Cables Under Attack\n\nBefore the Baltic incidents, Norway had its own cable attacks.\n\nIn January 2022, the [Svalbard fiber cable was damaged](https://www.nrk.no/nordland/den-russiske-fisketraleren-_melkart-5_-krysset-svalbardfiberen-over-140-ganger-1.16128138) - one of two cables connecting the world's largest polar satellite ground station to the mainland.\n\nNRK's investigation revealed the Russian trawler **Melkart-5** had crossed the cable area **more than 140 times**. In just the first nine days of January: **107 crossings**.\n\nWhen the ship docked in Båtsfjord, police questioned the captain. Despite investigators finding \"deep tracks on the seabed that might originate from a trawler door,\" the case was closed.\n\nA [joint Nordic investigation by NRK, DR, SVT and Yle](https://www.nrk.no/nordland/xl/fiskebater-og-andre-fartoy-fra-russland-kan-drive-spionasje-og-etterretning-i-norge-1.16371100) - presented in the Brennpunkt documentary *\"Skyggekrigen\"* (The Shadow War) - tracked hundreds of Russian vessels from 2013 to present:\n\n- At least **50 ships over 10 years** had opportunity to gather intelligence\n- Russian vessels were present when cables were damaged off **both Vesterålen and Svalbard**\n- Tracks found near small airports, deep-water quays, and critical bridges\n- Ships regularly turned off location transponders\n\nNorway's Intelligence Chief told NRK: *\"The intelligence activity is conducted on top of the normal commercial activity.\"*\n\nIn May 2025, [EU sanctioned the company](https://www.nrk.no/tromsogfinnmark/eu-straffer-russiske-_spionbater_-_-i-norge-legger-de-fortsatt-til-kai-1.17429222) owning Melkart-5 - but as NRK reported, the same vessels still dock in Norwegian ports.\n\n## The Baltic Sea Cable Attacks\n\nThe pattern extends across the region. The Baltic Sea has seen a wave of infrastructure attacks:\n\n| Date | Target | Suspected Vessel |\n|------|--------|------------------|\n| Oct 2023 | Balticconnector gas pipeline + telecom cables | NewNew Polar Bear (Chinese) |\n| Nov 2024 | BCS East-West Interlink + C-Lion1 cables | Yi Peng 3 (Chinese) |\n| Dec 2024 | Estlink 2 + 4 telecom cables | Eagle S (Russian shadow fleet) |\n| Feb 2025 | Germany-Finland data cable | Unknown |\n\nThe Eagle S dragged its anchor approximately **100 km along the seabed**. Estlink 2 was out of service for **over 7 months**.\n\nSince 2022, approximately **10 undersea cables** have been cut in the Baltic Sea - 7 of them between November 2024 and January 2025.\n\nIn January 2025, Norway [seized the ship Silver Dania](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/01/31/norway-seizes-ship-with-russian-crew-in-baltic-sea-cable-damage-investigation) with an all-Russian crew, suspected of involvement in Baltic cable damage.\n\n## What Norwegian Security Services Are Saying\n\nThe [February 2025 threat assessments](https://www.regjeringen.no/no/aktuelt/arets-trusselvurderinger-er-presentert/id3086625/) from Norway's three security services were unprecedented in their clarity:\n\n**PST Chief Beate Gangås:**\n> \"Overall, the threats from state actors against Norway are more unpredictable, more extensive, and more demanding than in many decades.\"\n\n> \"We expect 2025 to be characterized by compound threats. This includes sabotage, influence operations, and illegal intelligence gathering.\"\n\n**Intelligence Chief Nils Andreas Stensønes:**\n> \"Russia recruits criminals who do this for payment for Russian intelligence.\"\n\n**NSM Director Arne Christian Haugstøyl:**\n> \"Many Norwegian businesses are naive in the sense that they don't take the changes we've seen in recent years seriously enough.\"\n\n> \"It's no longer about whether it happens, but when it happens.\"\n\n> \"A state actor that wants to carry out a sabotage action will succeed.\"\n\nThat last quote deserves to sink in: **\"A state actor that wants to carry out a sabotage action will succeed.\"**\n\n## The Digital Dimension\n\nNow here's what should concern every Norwegian: if physical infrastructure like dams, cables, and GPS systems can be attacked, what about digital infrastructure?\n\nConsider what the Risevatnet hack revealed:\n- Weak passwords on critical systems\n- No multi-factor authentication\n- Internet-exposed control panels\n- Detection failure for hours\n\nNSM's [Risiko 2025 report](https://nsm.no/regelverk-og-hjelp/rapporter/risiko-2025) warns about:\n- Web-exposed control panels with weak passwords\n- Lack of multi-factor authentication\n- Insufficient segmentation of OT networks\n- Inadequate monitoring of ICS/SCADA systems\n\nAnd this is infrastructure Norway *controls*. What about the infrastructure we've outsourced?\n\n## The Uncomfortable Parallel\n\n**Physical infrastructure under attack:**\n- GPS signals jammed daily from Russian territory\n- Undersea cables cut by shadow fleet vessels\n- Dams hacked through exposed systems\n- PST: Sabotage is \"probable\" in 2025\n\n**Digital infrastructure we've outsourced:**\n- [63% of Norwegian cloud market](/blog/2025-12-13-war-fear-digital-dependency/) controlled by Microsoft\n- 81% controlled by American companies\n- 96% of state agencies using cloud services\n- All subject to the US CLOUD Act\n\nWe're hardening our physical defenses while simultaneously increasing our digital dependency on foreign actors.\n\n## The Question We're Not Asking\n\nWhen Russia jams GPS in Finnmark, we track it, report it, and work on alternatives.\n\nWhen pro-Russian hackers breach a Norwegian dam, we investigate and learn lessons.\n\nWhen cables are cut in the Baltic, NATO responds with \"Baltic Sentry\" and increased surveillance.\n\nBut when it comes to our digital infrastructure - the systems that run our hospitals, our government, our businesses - we keep moving *more* data and *more* services to American cloud providers.\n\nShouldn't the same vigilance apply to our digital infrastructure?\n\n## What NSM Recommends\n\n[NSM's recommendations](https://nsm.no/regelverk-og-hjelp/rapporter/risiko-2025) for businesses apply equally to digital sovereignty:\n\n1. **Map your own values and dependencies** - assess consequences of loss\n2. **Establish backup solutions** - for critical functions\n3. **Build repair readiness** - spare parts, personnel, *alternative providers*\n4. **Update contingency plans** - account for today's threat picture\n5. **Practice for loss** - of power, transport, internet, water, *cloud services*\n6. **Strengthen detection measures** - increase vigilance\n7. **Monitor digital systems** - reduce digital vulnerabilities\n\nNSM's key message: *\"Understand the risk. Reduce vulnerabilities. Build backup solutions.\"*\n\nThis applies to Microsoft 365 just as much as it applies to physical infrastructure.\n\n## The Timeline Should Alarm You\n\n| Date | Event |\n|------|-------|\n| 2017 | First GPS jamming during Zapad exercise |\n| 2022 | 122 days of jamming + Russia invades Ukraine |\n| 2023 | 294 days of jamming |\n| 2023 | Iranian cyber attack on Norway |\n| 2024 | 40 sabotage operations in Europe |\n| 2024 | Baltic cables cut repeatedly |\n| 2025 | Risevatnet dam hacked |\n| 2025 | PST: Sabotage is \"probable\" |\n| 2025 | GPS jamming so constant Nkom stops tracking |\n\nThe trend is clear. The threat is escalating. And we're responding to physical threats while ignoring digital ones.\n\n## Your Move\n\nNSM Director Haugstøyl warned: *\"We cannot expect more warnings before a potential sabotage action.\"*\n\nThe warnings have been given. The Risevatnet dam was hacked. The GPS is jammed daily. The cables are being cut.\n\nThe hybrid war is here. What are you going to do about it?\n\n### If You Lead an Organization\n\n- **Map your digital dependencies** - Which foreign providers could cut you off tomorrow?\n- **Demand exit strategies** - Can you export your data? How long would migration take?\n- **Test your backups** - When did you last verify recovery actually works?\n- **Include digital scenarios in crisis planning** - What if Microsoft, Google, or AWS became unavailable?\n- **Read [NSM Risiko 2025](https://nsm.no/regelverk-og-hjelp/rapporter/risiko-2025)** - The official recommendations apply to your digital infrastructure too\n\n### If You Work in IT or Development\n\n- **Advocate for European alternatives** - Nextcloud, Collabora, Open-Xchange exist and work\n- **Build with open standards** - Data in open formats can be moved; proprietary formats create lock-in\n- **Document dependencies** - Your organization needs to know what breaks if a provider disappears\n- **Implement proper security basics** - The Risevatnet dam was hacked through a weak password. Don't be next\n- **Consider sovereignty in architecture decisions** - Where does the data live? Who can access it?\n\n### If You Use Digital Services\n\n- **[Take control of your digital life](/blog/2025-12-12-take-control-digital-sovereignty/)** - Personal steps you can take today\n- **Ask your employer questions** - Where is company data stored? What's the backup plan?\n- **Support Norwegian and European alternatives** - Your choices shape the market\n- **Stay informed** - Follow [NSM](https://nsm.no), [PST](https://www.pst.no), and [E-tjenesten](https://www.etterretningstjenesten.no) for threat updates\n- **[Understand what's at stake](/blog/2025-12-13-war-fear-digital-dependency/)** - The trust equation has changed\n\n---\n\nThe hybrid war doesn't announce itself. It arrives as a jammed GPS signal, a hacked dam, a cut cable - or a cloud service that suddenly becomes unavailable.\n\n*\"It's no longer about whether it happens, but when it happens.\"*\n\nDon't wait for the digital equivalent of a cut cable to discover you needed a backup.\n\n---\n\n## Sources\n\n**Norwegian Security Assessments (February 2025):**\n- [E-tjenesten FOKUS 2025](https://www.etterretningstjenesten.no/publikasjoner/fokus/fokus2025_innhold) - Norwegian Intelligence Service annual assessment\n- [PST Nasjonal trusselvurdering 2025](https://www.pst.no/alle-artikler/artikler/sjefens-forord-ntv-2025/) - Police Security Service threat assessment\n- [NSM Risiko 2025](https://nsm.no/regelverk-og-hjelp/rapporter/risiko-2025) - National Security Authority risk assessment\n- [Regjeringen: Threat assessments presented](https://www.regjeringen.no/no/aktuelt/arets-trusselvurderinger-er-presentert/id3086625/)\n\n**GPS Jamming:**\n- [Nkom](https://www.nkom.no) - Norwegian Communications Authority statistics\n- [The Barents Observer](https://www.thebarentsobserver.com) - GPS jamming coverage\n- [High North News](https://www.highnorthnews.com) - Aviation impact reporting\n\n**Related Articles:**\n- [When Security Guarantees Crumble: What Norwegians' War Fear Reveals About Digital Dependency](/blog/2025-12-13-war-fear-digital-dependency/)\n- [Take Control: How You Can Protect Your Digital Life and Help Norway Stay Sovereign](/blog/2025-12-12-take-control-digital-sovereignty/)"

      "body": "In 1969, ARPANET introduced packet switching – a radical idea where data could route around damage. No single point of failure. The US military wanted communications that could survive a Soviet first strike.\n\nThe architecture was resilient by design. Distributed. Decentralized. Sovereign.\n\n## What we built instead\n\nFifty years later, European critical infrastructure runs on three American hyperscalers. We traded resilience for convenience. The same impulse that once distributed risk has now concentrated it:\n\n- **Legal exposure** – The [CLOUD Act](/laws/cloud-act/) gives US authorities access to data stored by American companies, regardless of where servers are physically located\n- **Regulatory uncertainty** – [Schrems II](/laws/schrems-ii/) invalidated Privacy Shield. The [EU-US Data Privacy Framework](/laws/eu-us-dpf/) is its fragile replacement – we're operating in legal grey zones.\n- **Supply chain opacity** – [NIS2](/laws/nis2/) demands control we don't actually have\n\nA policy change in Washington, a new sanctions regime, or a shift in trade relations could disrupt Nordic digital services overnight.\n\nBut that's the theoretical risk. The physical risk is already here.\n\n## This is not a drill\n\nWhile we debated data sovereignty in conference rooms, Russia began testing our infrastructure directly.\n\n**January 2022:** The Svalbard cable was cut. SvalSat handles roughly 30% of global polar orbit satellite downlinks – this wasn't just Norwegian infrastructure, it was a node in the world's space communications.\n\n**Ongoing:** Norwegian media has extensively documented Russian trawlers moving in zig-zag patterns along our coast – directly over known cable routes. These aren't fishing expeditions.\n\n**October 2023:** The Balticconnector pipeline and Estonia-Sweden telecom cables were damaged in the Baltic Sea.\n\nThe original ARPANET architects imagined Soviet missiles. They didn't imagine we'd voluntarily concentrate our infrastructure *and* face hybrid warfare – where cables get cut by \"accidents\" rather than warheads.\n\n## The dual vulnerability\n\nWe are now exposed on two axes simultaneously:\n\n1. **Physical layer** – Submarine cables can be cut. And they are being cut.\n2. **Logical layer** – Even if the cables survive, our services depend on control planes in Redmond, Seattle, and Mountain View.\n\nA distributed network means nothing if every node depends on the same American authentication service, the same cloud provider, the same DNS infrastructure.\n\n## Rebuilding resilience\n\nThis isn't about rejecting cloud computing. It's about remembering why distributed systems matter – and applying that principle at every layer:\n\n- **Infrastructure** – European and Nordic hosting with transparent supply chains\n- **Software** – Open source stacks we can inspect, modify, and operate ourselves\n- **Data** – Localization that means something legally, not just geographically\n- **Skills** – Operational sovereignty requires people who understand the systems, not just consume them\n\nThe internet's architects understood that resilience requires redundancy, distribution, and local control. We forgot. The cables off our coast are a reminder.\n\n---\n\n*For more on the active hybrid threat to Norwegian infrastructure, see [The Hybrid War Is Already Here](/blog/2025-12-15-hybrid-war-already-here/).*"
