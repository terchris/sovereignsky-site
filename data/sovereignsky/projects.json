Each product is deduplicated, categorized across four taxonomies, and enriched with vendor information, alternatives mappings, and sovereignty assessments.\n\n## Data Sources\n\nWe prioritize government-vetted catalogs for quality and legal compliance:\n\n| Source | Products | Publisher | Trust Level |\n|--------|----------|-----------|-------------|\n| SILL France | 626 | DINUM - French Government | Government-vetted |\n| CNCF Cloud Native Landscape | 1,358 | Cloud Native Computing Foundation | Foundation-backed |\n| Euro Stack | 1,103 | Abilian SAS / EuroStack Initiative (FR) | Expert-curated |\n| OpenAlternative | 649 | OpenAlternative | Community-curated |\n| Cloud Service Map | 582 | Google Cloud | Expert-curated |\n| switching.software | 130 | Datenpunks (DE) | Expert-curated |\n\n### Planned Sources\n\n| Source | Publisher | Trust Level |\n|--------|-----------|-------------|\n| openCode / ZenDiS | German Government (ZenDiS) | Government-vetted |\n| Developers Italia | Italian Government | Government-vetted |\n| EU OSS Catalogue | European Commission | Government-vetted |\n\n## The Challenges\n\n### Deduplication: One Product, Many Identities\n\nThe same software appears across catalogs with different identifiers. For example, Ansible appears as `ansible`, `red-hat-ansible`, and `ansible-automation-platform` depending on the source. We maintain a canonical registry with 942 product mappings that resolve duplicates across the 4,400+ raw entries from all sources.\n\n### Category Harmonization\n\nEach catalog uses its own category system - CNCF uses technical hierarchies, SILL France uses publiccode.yml categories, Euro-Stack uses business focus. We map all source categories to four standardized taxonomies:\n\n- **Technical** (43 categories): Infrastructure capabilities\n- **Developer** (26 categories): Development tools and frameworks\n- **Business** (28 categories): Use cases and departments\n- **Platforms** (8 categories): Operating systems and clouds\n\nThis requires 10,415+ lines of category mappings.\n\n### Data Enrichment\n\nRaw catalog data lacks context. We enrich products using Wikidata for vendor information (headquarters, founding date) and web search to validate descriptions and find missing homepages.\n\n## Goal: Fully Automated Pipeline\n\nThe target is a weekly automated pipeline that scrapes all sources, auto-suggests canonical ID mappings using fuzzy matching, and publishes the updated catalog - flagging conflicts for human review without blocking the pipeline.",

Applications are linked to business owners, technical owners, and other stakeholders, ensuring that responsibility is explicit rather than implicit.\n\nStakeholders are mapped to real identities through integration with Microsoft Entra ID, enabling accurate ownership, role-based access, and traceability over time—even as personnel change.\n\n## Integrations & APIs as First-Class Items\n\nBeyond applications, Bifrost models integrations and APIs as first-class configuration items. Every integration and API is assigned a unique integration identifier (INT number) and documented with:\n\n- Purpose and direction\n- Data classification\n- Lifecycle status\n- Independent stakeholders and owners\n\nAPIs can have their own stakeholders and owners, independent of the applications they connect, reflecting real-world responsibility for interface contracts, security, and availability.\n\n## Dependency Visualization\n\nUsing interactive dependency and integration visualizations, Bifrost shows:\n\n- How applications and APIs are interconnected\n- Which systems depend on which interfaces\n- Where critical business processes are exposed to risk\n\nThis enables accurate impact analysis, supports change management, and reduces uncertainty during incidents or modernization efforts.\n\n## Automation & Integration\n\nTo reduce manual effort and ensure adoption, Bifrost supports:\n\n- **Bulk Import** - Synchronization with Excel and ServiceNow\n- **Documentation Generation** - Auto-generate wikis and PDF catalogs\n- **Living Source of Truth** - Continuously updated model rather than static inventory\n\n## Technical Stack\n\n| Component | Technology |\n|-----------|------------|\n| Frontend | Next.js 14 (App Router) |\n| Backend | Strapi CMS |\n| API | TypeScript |\n| Database | SQLite (dev) / PostgreSQL (prod) |\n| Deployment | Kubernetes, Docker |",

      "body": "## What Is DevContainer Toolbox?\n\nDevContainer Toolbox establishes a single, reproducible development environment that works identically on Windows, macOS, and Linux—eliminating environment drift and the classic \"it works on my machine\" problem.\n\nBy using the Dev Container standard, the entire development environment is defined as code and version-controlled alongside the application source. When a developer checks out a repository, they get not only the code, but also the exact tools, runtimes, CLI utilities, and configurations required to build, run, debug, and test it—ready to use in minutes.\n\n## Fast and Predictable Onboarding\n\nOnboarding new developers becomes trivial. There is no need for lengthy setup guides, local tool installation, or troubleshooting OS-specific issues. Opening the project in a supported IDE automatically builds and launches the devcontainer with everything installed and configured.\n\nThis enables:\n\n- New developers to be productive on day one\n- External consultants to work in a controlled, compliant environment\n- Teams to scale without increasing setup and support overhead\n\n## A Toolbox, Not a Single-Purpose Container\n\nDevContainer Toolbox is designed as a shared foundation for many types of development work. It includes a rich base environment and a modular architecture for extending functionality as needed.\n\nThe `.devcontainer` directory is structured to support this:\n\n| Directory | Purpose |\n|-----------|----------|\n| `manage/` | Commands and orchestration logic for setup, extension, and maintenance |\n| `additions/` | Scripts that install and configure tools for specific languages and use cases |\n\nThis approach allows teams to enable support for multiple programming languages and technology stacks from a single, standardized container image.\n\n## Multi-Language Support\n\nThe toolbox includes commands and templates for:\n\n| Languages | Frameworks |\n|-----------|------------|\n| C# / .NET | Next.js, React |\n| Python | Express, Spring Boot |\n| Node.js / TypeScript | Web APIs |\n| Go, Java, PHP | Backend services |\n\n## IDE and Platform Support\n\nWorks consistently across Windows, macOS, and Linux with:\n\n- Visual Studio Code\n- JetBrains Rider\n- Visual Studio\n\nThe container abstracts away host OS differences, ensuring that builds, scripts, and tooling behave the same for every developer.\n\n## Security and Stability\n\nBecause all tooling runs inside the container:\n\n- The local machine remains clean and unaffected\n- Developers can safely experiment without breaking their host system\n- Tool versions and dependencies are pinned and auditable\n- Security teams gain better control and predictability\n\nThe base image is built on **Debian 12 (Bookworm)** and includes essential CLI tools such as Azure CLI, Python, Node.js, and common utilities required for modern cloud-native development.\n\n## Key Benefits\n\n- **Consistent environments** across all developers and platforms\n- **Ultra-fast onboarding** with no manual setup\n- **Environment-as-code** checked in alongside application source\n- **Modular architecture** for diverse development needs\n- **Reduced support overhead** and troubleshooting\n- **Improved collaboration** through identical tooling and workflows",
