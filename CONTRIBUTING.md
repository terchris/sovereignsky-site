Thank you for your interest in helping make Norway more digitally sovereign! 🇳🇴

## How to Contribute

### 1. Report Issues or Suggest Improvements

The easiest way to contribute is by [creating an issue](https://github.com/terchris/sovereignsky-site/issues/new/choose):

- **Bug Report** - Something isn't working correctly
- **Feature Request** - Suggest new functionality  
- **UI/Mobile Improvement** - Report display issues
- **Content Suggestion** - Suggest software, publications, events, etc.

Please use the issue templates - they help us understand and implement your suggestions faster.

### 2. What Happens After You Create an Issue?

1. **Triage** - We review new issues and add appropriate labels
2. **Planning** - Approved issues become implementation plans in `docs/plans/backlog/`
3. **Implementation** - We work through the backlog, moving plans to `docs/plans/active/`
4. **Completion** - Implemented features move to `docs/plans/completed/`

You can track progress by watching the `docs/plans/` folder.
