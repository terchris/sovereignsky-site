ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This publication is the third edition of what has been, until the second edition, a joint publication I curated together with Prof.

Christopher Kuner of the Brussels Privacy Hub, an academic research centre of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB; Free University of Brussels) in Brussels, Belgium.

Therefore, fi rst and foremost I would like to thank Christopher for his key role and contribution as co-convener of the Data Protection in Humanitarian Action working series and as co-editor of the resulting fi rst and second editions.

His guidance, knowledge, expertise and mentorship over the years constitute strong foundations for the Handbook and continue to guide the spirit of this publication.

This third edition includes two new chapters which meet an important need for guidance that has clearly emerged since the second edition was published.

In the fi rst of these new chapters, Carmela Troncoso and Wouter Lueks provide guidance on how to approach data protection by design, and how to design programmes and systems in ways that integrate data protection from the outset.

This chapter is a pivotal contribution that is relevant for all the technology areas discussed in Part II.

In the second new chapter, Andrea Raab-Gray looks more closely at the challenges faced by humanitarian organizations using cloud-based tools vis-à-vis their capacity to keep the data they collect under their exclusive control and ensure their use for exclusively humanitarian purposes.

More speci fi cally, it provides guidance on how to analyse possible sources of “ lawful ” access to humanitarian data by governments through Third Party processors such as cloud service providers.

For all other pre-existing chapters, authors who primarily or signi fi cantly contributed to those chapters curated their update to ensure they are up to date with the latest trends, developments and analyses.

The text of this edition is up to date as at the date of submission of the manuscript, 10 December 2022.

I would therefore also like to thank my co-authors who curated chapters in this third edition: Carmela Troncoso, Wouter Lueks, Paolo Balboni, Andrea Raab-Gray, Lina Jasmontaite-Zaniewicz, Júlia Zomignani Barboza, Vincent Graf Narbel, Alessandro Mantelero, Aaron Martin and John Warnes.

It was a great privilege to work together both on this edition of the Handbook and on the many initiatives and projects that fed into it.

Like the previous editions, this one has bene fi ted greatly from the insights provided through consultations, workshops, interviews, panels and conferences – including the DigitHarium working series that took place throughout 2021 1 – that brought 1 ICRC, “ DigitHarium ” , ICRC, 2021, www.icrc.org/en/digitharium. use, available at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/025CE3DFD1FAD908DD1412C20E49F955 Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

For many years now our work in the area of data protection in humanitarian action has thrived thanks to generous support from the Luxembourg Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs, and the third edition of this Handbook is one of the concrete manifestations of this work.

I am very thankful for the continued engagement and contribution of a number of extraordinary communities which, together, continue to provide the knowledge and xxii ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS use, available at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/025CE3DFD1FAD908DD1412C20E49F955 Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

IP address: 81.191.134.126, on 20 Dec 2025 at 16:53:10, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of insights necessary to detect, anticipate and navigate new trends and dilemmas facing the humanitarian sector in digital transformation.

First, the community of humani- tarian practitioners: dedicated colleagues at the International Committee of the Red Cross, National Societies of the Red Cross and the Red Crescent, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, UN Agencies, and other organ- izations on the front line of humanitarian action.

Driven by a relentless commitment to maximize the bene fi t of new technologies for vulnerable communities affected by humanitarian emergencies while ensuring their protection, dignity and agency, these practitioners provide the necessary fi eld “ reality check ” to ensure that the guidance provided is meaningful and realistic in the extraordinary circumstances presented by humanitarian crises.

Second, the community of data protection supervisory author- ities and experts within the framework of the Global Privacy Assembly and the Council of Europe Consultative Committee for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data Convention 108 (T-PD) provide an extremely insightful space for exchange, re fl ection, and development of guidance on the application of key data protection rules to new technologies and technology areas.

Third, the academic community of the European Centre on Privacy and Cybersecurity at Maastricht University and the Lausanne and Zurich Polytechnics, with unparalleled cutting-edge expertise in law and computer science respectively.

These partnerships provide the type of forward-thinking environment, free of con- straints, that academia can offer.

Speci fi c credits and acknowledgements relating to the previous editions are reported therein.

It can be very dif fi cult to assess the risk of Reidenti fi cation with absolute certainty.

SaaS – Software as a Service Sensitive Data means Personal Data which, if disclosed, may result in discrimination against or the repression of the individual concerned.

Typically, data relating to health, race or ethnicity, religious/political/armed group af fi liation, or genetic and biometric data are considered to be Sensitive Data.

All Sensitive Data require aug- mented protection even though different types of data falling under the scope of Sensitive Data (e.g. different types of biometric data) may present different levels of sensitivity.

Given the speci fi c situations in which Humanitarian Organizations work and the possibility that some data elements could give rise to discrimination, setting out a de fi nitive list of Sensitive Data categories in Humanitarian Action is not meaningful.

Sensitivity of data as well as appropriate safeguards (e.g. technical and organizational security measures) have to be considered on a case-by-case basis.

SLA – A service-level agreement is an of fi cial commitment between a service pro- vider and a client, particularly for the provision of reliable telecommunications and Internet services.

Sought Person is a person unaccounted for, for whom a tracing operation has been launched.
