FOREWORD TO THE THIRD EDITION The work of humanitarian organizations requires the processing of Personal Data.

They must work as effectively and ef fi ciently as possible to assist individuals faced with persecution or natural disasters, so protecting the processing of their Personal Data can literally be a matter of life and death.

Despite its great bene fi ts, Data Processing (particularly that carried out online) also brings risks, such as the poten- tial for data misuse and threats to cyber security.

This is why data protection has become essential for humanitarian organizations to ful fi l their mandates, and why it is increasingly expected by their stakeholders.

The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the Brussels Privacy Hub have already published jointly two editions of their Handbook on Data Protection in Humanitarian Action , of which I was proud to be co-editor.

They provide guidance for organizations working in the humanitarian sector to implement data protection in their operations.

However, since then the risks of data misuse, security breaches and unauthorized Data Processing have continued to grow, new legal issues surrounding Data Processing have emerged and the challenges for humanitarian organizations have increased correspondingly.

I am thus very happy that Massimo Marelli of the ICRC has edited this third edition of the Handbook , which is needed given the growing legal and practical complexity of implementing data protection.

It goes beyond the fi rst two editions by covering additional topics such as risk mitigation, digital contact tracing and government access, among others.

It also provides further elucidation of both the relevant legal issues and the practical challenges that humanitarian organizations face.

Data protection must constantly evolve to meet threats to Data Processing.

This third edition of the Handbook will be a key tool for humanitarian organizations to protect the data of vulnerable individuals and to ful fi l their mandates.

Personal data protection is of fundamental importance for humanitarian organiza- tions as it is an integral part of protecting the life, integrity and dignity of their bene fi ciaries.

In 2015, the 37th International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners adopted the Resolution on Privacy and International Humanitarian Action.

One of the resolution ’ s aims was to meet the demand among humanitarian actors for cooperation to develop guidance on data protection.

A working group was set up and became involved in the Data Protection in Humanitarian Action project, run jointly by the BPH and the ICRC, whose objectives were to explore the relation- ship between data protection laws and humanitarian action, to understand the impact of new technologies on data protection in the humanitarian sector and to formulate appropriate guidance.

The project brought together humanitarian organizations, data protection authorities and technology experts in a series of workshops covering a range of topics, including data analytics, drones, biometrics, cash transfer programming, cloud-based comput- ing and messaging apps, all of which have become increasingly important in the humanitarian sector.

The Handbook is one of the outputs of this project; it will be a useful tool to raise awareness and assist humanitarian organizations in complying with personal data protection standards.

It also addresses the need for speci fi c guidance on the inter- pretation of data protection principles as applicable to humanitarian action, espe- cially when new technologies are employed.

I believe the Handbook will prove helpful to humanitarian actors, data protection authorities and private companies alike.

It clearly demonstrates that data protection legislation does not prohibit the collection and sharing of personal data, but rather provides the framework in which personal data can be used in the knowledge and con fi dence that individuals ’ right to privacy is respected. use, available at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/025CE3DFD1FAD908DD1412C20E49F955 Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.
