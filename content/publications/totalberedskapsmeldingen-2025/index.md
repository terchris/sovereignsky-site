## Summary

The Totalberedskapsmeldingen (Total Preparedness Report) is a landmark Norwegian government white paper presented on 10 January 2025 by Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre and Minister of Justice and Public Security Emilie Enger Mehl. The document marks what the government describes as a "historic turning point" for Norwegian preparedness, moving beyond the post-Cold War assumption of "deep peace" that has characterised planning since the 1990s.

The white paper follows up on the recommendations of the Totalberedskapskommisjonen (Total Preparedness Commission) and contains over 100 specific measures affecting individuals, public sector, business, and all societal sectors.

## Three Main Goals

The report establishes three overarching objectives for strengthening civil society's resilience:

| Goal | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Prepared for crisis and war** | A civil society that is ready to prevent and handle crises, from natural disasters to armed conflict |
| **Resilient against hybrid threats** | A civil society that can withstand compound/hybrid threats including disinformation, cyber attacks, and foreign interference |
| **Supporting military efforts** | A civil society that can sustain and support military operations during security crises and armed conflict |

---

## Key Measures

### Civil Protection and Preparedness

- **Long-term plan for civil preparedness** to be developed, with work starting in 2025
- **Sivilforsvaret** (Civil Defence) to expand from 8,000 to 12,000 service personnel over eight years
- **Shelter construction ban from 1998 to be lifted** — new buildings will be required to include shelters
- **Civil labour duty** to be legislated for security crises or war

### Governance and Coordination

- **Mandatory preparedness councils** (beredskapsråd) in all municipalities, regions, and critical societal areas — bringing together authorities, voluntary organisations, and businesses to prevent, exercise, and handle crises
- **100 million NOK increase** in funding for voluntary rescue service organisations through an 8-year escalation plan
- **Regular reconvening** of total preparedness commissions

### Food and Supply Security

- **50% food self-sufficiency** target by 2030
- **3-month grain reserves** to be established by 2029

### Cyber and Digital Security

- **New cyber preparedness scheme** through public-private cooperation to handle serious cyber incidents
- **National security strategy** to be developed

### Property and Ownership Control

- **Pre-approval system** for purchase of certain properties of potential interest to threat actors
- **New registry system** for property ownership in Norway, complementing the new beneficial ownership registry for companies

### Maritime Security

- Strengthened control at sea and in the maritime sector, in cooperation with the Armed Forces

### Information Resilience

- **Strategy against disinformation** to strengthen population's source criticism capabilities

## Context

The white paper was written against the backdrop of:

- Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine
- Conflict in the Middle East
- Intensified global competition and rivalry between great powers over military, political, economic, and technological power

As stated in the presentation:

> "We are leaving behind the time period we have lived in since the 1990s and the fall of the Berlin Wall, with preparedness based on deep peace. Going forward, we must plan for a new era."

## Implications for Voluntary Organisations

The white paper significantly expands the role of voluntary organisations in Norwegian preparedness:

- Mandatory inclusion in local, regional, and national preparedness councils
- Substantial funding increases (100 million NOK over 8 years for rescue organisations)
- Recognition of voluntary organisations as essential partners in total defence

This builds on and validates the findings of the [FFI report on voluntary emergency organisations](/publications/ffi-frivillige-beredskapsorganisasjoner-totalforsvar/), which documented the capabilities and potential contributions of organisations like Norwegian Red Cross, Norwegian People's Aid, and Norske Kvinners Sanitetsforening.
