This section collects authoritative publications from respected institutions and researchers. These are external sources we consider essential reading for understanding digital sovereignty, data protection, and the risks of digital dependency.

**We curate and reference — we do not create content here.**

## Why These Sources Matter

When evaluating digital sovereignty risks, credible evidence matters. Policy decisions, organizational strategies, and technical choices should be grounded in research from institutions with:

- **Operational experience** — organisations working in complex, high-risk environments
- **Academic rigour** — peer-reviewed research and established publishers
- **Institutional standing** — recognised bodies with mandates in their fields

## Selection Criteria

We include publications that are:

| Criterion | What We Look For |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Credibility** | Recognised institutions, academic publishers, official bodies |
| **Relevance** | Directly addresses sovereignty, jurisdiction, data protection, or digital risk |
| **Utility** | Offers frameworks, analysis, or guidance applicable to organisations |
| **Accessibility** | Available to read (open access preferred, but not required) |

## How to Use This Section

Each entry provides:

- What the publication covers
- Who created it and why they're authoritative
- Key topics addressed
- Direct link to the source

Use these references to inform your own analysis, support policy decisions, or deepen understanding of specific topics.
