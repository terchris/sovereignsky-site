description: "UK law creating new criminal offenses for espionage, foreign interference, and sabotage, with powers to address state threats."
abstract: "The National Security Act modernizes UK espionage laws for the digital age. It creates offenses for obtaining and disclosing protected information, foreign interference in UK politics, and sabotage of critical infrastructure. It also establishes a foreign influence registration scheme."
summary: "The UK National Security Act 2023 updates laws against espionage and foreign interference that dated back to the Official Secrets Act 1911. It creates new offenses for obtaining, copying, or disclosing protected information to foreign powers; foreign interference in UK politics and civil society; and sabotage of critical national infrastructure. The Act establishes a Foreign Influence Registration Scheme requiring registration of activities conducted at the direction of foreign powers. It provides new powers to restrict individuals assessed as threats to national security, including prevention and investigation measures. The law responds to evolving state-level threats including cyber operations and covert influence campaigns. For organizations, it increases the legal risks of unauthorized disclosure and may affect partnerships with foreign entities."
