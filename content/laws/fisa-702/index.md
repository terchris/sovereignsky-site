title: "FISA Section 702"
identifier: "fisa-702"
alternateName: "Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Section 702"
description: "US law authorizing warrantless surveillance of non-US persons located outside the United States for foreign intelligence purposes."
abstract: "FISA Section 702 allows the NSA and other agencies to collect communications of foreign targets without individual warrants. Communications providers must assist with collection. Non-US persons have minimal legal protections, and 'incidental collection' of US persons' communications raises ongoing civil liberties concerns."
summary: "FISA Section 702 authorizes intelligence agencies to conduct surveillance targeting non-US persons reasonably believed to be located outside the US for foreign intelligence purposes. Unlike traditional FISA, Section 702 does not require individual court orders for each target. The FISA Court approves annual targeting and minimization procedures, but not individual targets. Major tech companies including Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and Apple must comply with directives to provide access to communications. The PRISM program operates under Section 702 authority. For EU data protection, Section 702 is problematic because it enables bulk collection of Europeans' data with no meaningful judicial oversight or individual rights. The Schrems II ruling cited Section 702 as a key reason for invalidating the EU-US Privacy Shield. Recent reauthorizations have expanded some authorities while adding limited safeguards."
