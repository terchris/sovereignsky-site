When you use cloud software, your data may be subject to laws in the vendor’s home country—regardless of where the data is physically stored. This is called **jurisdiction exposure**.

## What This Means for Your Organization

If you use software from a US company (Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, Salesforce, etc.), your data may be accessible to US authorities even if:
- ✅ You store data in your home country
- ✅ You use EU Data Boundary settings
- ✅ You encrypt your data (unless you control the keys)

**Mitigation strategies:**
1. Choose vendors from safe jurisdictions (EU/EEA companies)
2. Self-host where possible
3. Use customer-managed encryption keys
4. Understand what data you’re storing and its sensitivity
