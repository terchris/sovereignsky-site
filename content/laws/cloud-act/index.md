title: "CLOUD Act"
identifier: "cloud-act"
alternateName: "Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act"
description: "US law enabling law enforcement to compel US technology companies to disclose data regardless of where it is physically stored."
abstract: "The CLOUD Act establishes that US jurisdiction follows the company, not the data location. US companies must comply with warrants for data they control even if stored in EU datacenters. This creates direct conflicts with GDPR and undermines the 'datacenter location' approach to data sovereignty."
summary: "The CLOUD Act allows US law enforcement to compel US-based technology companies to provide data stored on their servers regardless of physical location. Storing data in an EU datacenter operated by Microsoft, Amazon, or Google does not shield it from US government access. The law was passed in response to the Microsoft Ireland case where Microsoft refused to hand over emails stored in Ireland. It creates legal conflicts with GDPR: US companies face an impossible choice between complying with US law (disclose data) or EU law (protect data). For humanitarian organizations and enterprises handling sensitive data, CLOUD Act exposure is a critical sovereignty concern. Mitigations include using non-US providers, client-side encryption with self-managed keys, and zero-knowledge architectures. The EU-US Data Privacy Framework does not eliminate CLOUD Act powers; US companies remain subject to disclosure orders."
