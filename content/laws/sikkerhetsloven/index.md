identifier: "sikkerhetsloven"
alternateName: "Lov om nasjonal sikkerhet (National Security Act)"
description: "Norwegian law protecting national security through security clearances, classified information protection, and critical infrastructure safeguards."
abstract: "Sikkerhetsloven establishes Norway's framework for protecting national security interests. It covers security clearances, protection of classified information, security in government procurement, and safeguarding critical infrastructure from threats including foreign ownership and intelligence activities."
summary: "The Norwegian Security Act creates a comprehensive framework for national security. It requires security clearances for personnel accessing classified information and establishes classification levels (RESTRICTED, CONFIDENTIAL, SECRET, TOP SECRET). Organizations handling classified information must implement security measures and undergo security audits. The Act enables the government to impose security requirements on critical infrastructure operators and assess foreign investments for national security risks. It covers information security (protecting classified data), personnel security (vetting individuals), and supply chain security (managing risks in procurement). NSM (Norwegian National Security Authority) oversees implementation, while PST (Police Security Service) handles threat assessments. The law interacts with data protection rules, allowing certain national security exemptions while maintaining proportionality requirements."
