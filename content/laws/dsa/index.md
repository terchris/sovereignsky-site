title: "DSA"
identifier: "dsa"
alternateName: "Digital Services Act"
description: "EU regulation establishing platform liability rules and transparency requirements for online intermediaries and marketplaces."
abstract: "The DSA creates a tiered liability framework for online intermediaries based on their size and role. It requires notice-and-takedown mechanisms, transparency reporting, algorithmic accountability for very large platforms (VLOPs), and risk assessments for systemic risks to democracy, public health, and fundamental rights."
summary: "The Digital Services Act modernizes the EU's e-Commerce Directive for the platform age. All online intermediaries must establish notice-and-action mechanisms for illegal content and publish transparency reports. Online platforms face additional obligations around traceability of traders, advertising transparency, and recommender system parameters. Very Large Online Platforms and Search Engines (over 45 million EU users) must conduct annual systemic risk assessments, submit to independent audits, provide data access to researchers, and implement crisis response protocols. The Act also bans dark patterns, targeted advertising to minors, and profiling based on sensitive data. The European Commission directly supervises VLOPs while member states oversee smaller platforms through Digital Services Coordinators."
