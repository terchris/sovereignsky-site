title: "AI Act"
identifier: "ai-act"
alternateName: "Regulation on Artificial Intelligence"
description: "World's first comprehensive AI law establishing a risk-based framework that prohibits certain AI practices and regulates high-risk systems."
abstract: "The AI Act categorizes AI systems by risk level: prohibited (social scoring, emotion recognition at work, predictive policing), high-risk (critical infrastructure, education, employment, law enforcement), and limited/minimal risk. High-risk AI must meet strict requirements for data quality, documentation, transparency, human oversight, and accuracy."
summary: "The EU AI Act is the first comprehensive legal framework for artificial intelligence globally. It bans AI systems deemed unacceptable (social scoring, real-time biometric identification in public spaces for law enforcement, manipulation techniques). High-risk AI in areas like critical infrastructure, education, employment, credit scoring, and law enforcement must undergo conformity assessments, maintain technical documentation, implement human oversight mechanisms, and meet accuracy and robustness standards. General-purpose AI models have transparency obligations including disclosing training data summaries and energy consumption. Foundation model providers face additional requirements around systemic risk assessment. The regulation applies extraterritorially to anyone placing AI systems on the EU market."
