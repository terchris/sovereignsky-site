description: "Russian system requiring all telecommunications providers to install FSB-accessible surveillance backdoors."
abstract: "SORM mandates that all telecommunications equipment in Russia include hardware and software enabling direct FSB access to communications. Providers must install and maintain surveillance equipment at their expense, with direct connections to FSB facilities for real-time monitoring."
summary: "SORM (Sistema Operativno-Rozysknykh Meropriyatiy) is Russia's surveillance system requiring all telecom providers to install backdoor access for the FSB. First established for telephone surveillance in 1995 (SORM-1), it expanded to internet (SORM-2) and later to all communications data (SORM-3). Providers must purchase and install certified surveillance equipment connected directly to FSB facilities. The FSB can access communications in real-time without provider involvement; companies simply provide the technical capability. Unlike Western lawful interception where providers receive and process warrants, SORM's architecture gives the FSB direct access. While warrants are theoretically required, providers have no ability to verify them. Any telecommunications provider operating in Russia must implement SORM, making it impossible to offer truly private communications services in the Russian market."
