title: "Data Act"
identifier: "data-act"
alternateName: "Regulation on harmonised rules on fair access to and use of data"
description: "EU regulation establishing rules for data sharing, public sector access to private data, and cloud switching rights."
abstract: "The Data Act creates new rights for users to access and share data generated by connected devices and related services. It establishes obligations for data holders, enables public sector access to private data in emergencies, and gives customers the right to switch cloud providers without lock-in."
summary: "The Data Act addresses the growing importance of non-personal data in the digital economy. It grants users of connected products (IoT devices, industrial machinery) the right to access data they generate and share it with third parties. Data holders must make data available in standardized formats. The Act also creates a framework for public bodies to request private sector data during emergencies like pandemics or natural disasters. For cloud services, it mandates interoperability standards and prohibits contractual barriers to switching providers. Organizations must implement technical measures to prevent unlawful international data transfers upon government requests from non-EU countries."
