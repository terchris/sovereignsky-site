description: "Russian anti-terrorism law requiring communications data retention for 6 months and mandatory assistance with decryption."
abstract: "The Yarovaya Law requires telecom providers and internet companies to retain communications content for 6 months and metadata for 3 years. Companies must provide authorities with decryption assistance, effectively requiring backdoor capabilities. Encrypted messaging services must register encryption keys with the government."
summary: "Russia's Yarovaya Law, passed in 2016 as anti-terrorism legislation, imposes extensive surveillance requirements. Communications providers must retain the content of all communications (voice, text, images, video) for 6 months and metadata for 3 years. When requested, providers must assist the FSB with decrypting communications. Messaging services using encryption must provide the government with decryption keys or face blocking. Several services including LinkedIn and Telegram have been blocked for non-compliance (Telegram was later unblocked after cooperation). The storage requirements are massive, requiring providers to build significant infrastructure. Combined with SORM and data localization requirements, the Yarovaya Law ensures Russian authorities have comprehensive access to communications occurring within Russia."
