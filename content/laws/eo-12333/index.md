identifier: "eo-12333"
alternateName: "Executive Order 12333 - United States Intelligence Activities"
description: "Presidential directive authorizing US intelligence agencies to collect signals intelligence on foreign targets outside US territory."
abstract: "EO 12333 provides the primary legal framework for NSA signals intelligence collection overseas. Unlike FISA which covers collection inside the US, EO 12333 governs bulk collection of data transiting international cables and stored abroad. Non-US persons receive minimal protections under this framework."
summary: "Executive Order 12333, signed by President Reagan in 1981 and amended multiple times since, authorizes US intelligence agencies to conduct signals intelligence collection outside US borders. This includes intercepting communications transiting international fiber optic cables (upstream collection) and accessing data stored in foreign datacenters. Unlike FISA, which involves judicial oversight, EO 12333 collection is governed primarily by executive branch policies with limited external review. The order was central to Schrems II because it enables bulk collection of European communications without individualized suspicion or meaningful redress. For data sovereignty, EO 12333 is particularly concerning because data need not be held by a US company—any data traversing US infrastructure or accessible from US territory may be subject to collection. PPD-28 and EO 14086 have added some safeguards for allied nations' citizens, but fundamental collection authorities remain intact."
