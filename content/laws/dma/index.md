title: "DMA"
identifier: "dma"
alternateName: "Digital Markets Act"
description: "EU regulation imposing obligations on designated 'gatekeeper' platforms to ensure fair competition and contestability."
abstract: "The DMA targets large platforms that act as gatekeepers between businesses and consumers. Designated gatekeepers must allow interoperability, enable data portability, refrain from self-preferencing, and provide fair access terms to business users. Non-compliance can result in fines up to 10% of global turnover."
summary: "The Digital Markets Act addresses the market power of dominant digital platforms. The European Commission designates gatekeepers based on turnover, user thresholds, and market position in core platform services (search, social networks, messaging, app stores, advertising, cloud). Gatekeepers face specific obligations: they cannot combine personal data across services without consent, must allow third-party app installation and default settings changes, cannot rank their own products favorably, must provide advertisers with performance data, and must enable messaging interoperability. Business users get rights to access their data, use alternative payment systems, and receive fair treatment in rankings. The Commission can impose fines up to 10% of global turnover and, for systematic infringement, order structural remedies including forced divestiture."
