description: "Post-9/11 US law significantly expanding surveillance powers for terrorism investigations, including Section 215 business records collection."
abstract: "The Patriot Act expanded FBI and NSA authorities for national security investigations. Section 215 allowed bulk collection of telephony metadata until reformed by the USA FREEDOM Act. The law lowered barriers for obtaining business records, enabled roving wiretaps, and expanded information sharing between intelligence and law enforcement."
summary: "The USA PATRIOT Act, passed after September 11, 2001, dramatically expanded US surveillance capabilities. Key provisions include Section 215, which authorized the FBI to obtain 'any tangible things' relevant to terrorism investigations including business records, until the USA FREEDOM Act restricted bulk collection. The law enabled National Security Letters (NSLs) demanding records from communications providers without court approval. It facilitated information sharing between foreign intelligence and domestic law enforcement. 'Sneak and peek' searches allow delayed notification of search warrants. Roving wiretaps can follow targets across devices without new court orders. While some provisions have sunset dates requiring reauthorization, the framework fundamentally changed US surveillance law. For international organizations, the Patriot Act exemplifies the broad access authorities that create tension with data protection regimes like GDPR."
