Zero-friction developer platform for building, testing, and deploying modern apps without needing to know Kubernetes, GitOps, or the cloud. Same infrastructure locally, in cloud, and on-premises.

## The Problem It Solves

- **'It works on my machine' syndrome** - Applications behave differently in development vs production
- **Complex cloud setup** - Developers waste time configuring cloud services
- **Permission bottlenecks** - Waiting for cloud access slows development
- **Expensive development** - Cloud costs accumulate during development
- **Data privacy concerns** - Sensitive data must leave your environment for cloud AI

## What's Included

| Category | Services |
|----------|----------|
| Core Infrastructure | Kubernetes cluster, Docker runtime, Provision Host |
| Data Services | PostgreSQL, Redis, message queues, object storage |
| AI & Machine Learning | Local ChatGPT-like system, private AI models, local LLM execution |
| Development Tools | GitOps workflows, dev containers, Infrastructure as Code |

## Key Benefits

- **Rapid Development** - Everything ready out of the box
- **True Portability** - Same environment everywhere
- **Data Privacy** - Nothing leaves your machine
- **Cost Effective** - No cloud charges during development
- **Production Confidence** - Test with real infrastructure locally
