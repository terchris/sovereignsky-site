# SovereignSky

**Secure developer access. Cloud independence. Zero trust.**

SovereignSky provides developers with secure access to internal services without exposing their machines to the organization network.

## The Problem

Organizations face multiple risks when providing developers access to internal services:

- **Security Risk** - Developer machines may be compromised with malware
- **Operational Risk** - Developers need freedom to install tools, conflicting with IT security
- **Geopolitical Risk** - Dependency on US cloud providers creates regulatory and political exposure
- **Vendor Lock-in** - Proprietary cloud features make migration extremely difficult

Traditional solutions like VPN give the entire developer machine access to the network - including any malware.

## The Solution

SovereignSky creates an **isolated gateway** on the developer's machine - a "clean computer within an infected computer". Only this gateway has access to internal services. Malware on the host machine cannot reach your network.
