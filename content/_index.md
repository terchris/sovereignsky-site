**Norway is mobilizing for crisis and war preparedness.**

The government, military, and civil society are sounding the alarm. GPS jamming, cyber attacks, infrastructure sabotage — the threats are real and growing.

**But are you prepared digitally?**

## What we've mapped

{{< stats >}}

## You know the threat. Here's how to act.

SovereignSky helps organizations understand and reduce their digital dependencies on foreign powers.

While others raise awareness about Totalforsvarsåret, we focus on practical tools — **helping the helpers** take action.

## The Problem Is Clear

**Your data is subject to foreign laws.**

| Fact | Implication |
|------|-------------|
| **63%** of Norwegian cloud market is Microsoft | Single point of failure |
| **81%** controlled by American companies | Subject to US law |
| **96%** of government agencies use cloud | Critical dependency |
| All subject to **US CLOUD Act** | Data can be seized without Norwegian court order |

A single political decision in Washington could disrupt Norwegian hospitals, government services, and critical infrastructure.

## About

SovereignSky is a [helpers.no](https://helpers.no) initiative.

During the Ukraine refugee crisis in 2022, helpers.no coordinated volunteer efforts at Europe's largest refugee transit center. That experience taught us: **preparedness requires infrastructure before the crisis hits.**

The same applies to digital infrastructure. When geopolitical events make foreign cloud services unavailable, it will be too late to build alternatives.
