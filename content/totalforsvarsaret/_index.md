In 2026, Norway mobilizes for a new security reality. **Totalforsvarsåret** (Total Defence Year) is a national effort coordinated by DSB and the Armed Forces to strengthen Norway's collective resilience against crisis and war.

Digital infrastructure is at the heart of this effort. When hospitals, government services, energy systems, and communications all depend on digital systems — cybersecurity and data sovereignty become questions of national survival.

## What Is Total Defence?

Total defence (*totalforsvar*) is the principle that **all of society must contribute to national security** — not just the military. It encompasses:

- **Civil preparedness** — Emergency services, healthcare, food supply, energy
- **Military defence** — Armed forces and national security
- **Civil-military cooperation** — Coordination between sectors during crisis

The concept dates back to Norway's Cold War planning but was deprioritized after 1990. Russia's war against Ukraine and the changing security landscape have brought it back with urgency.

### The Totalberedskapsmeldingen

In January 2025, the Norwegian government presented [Totalberedskapsmeldingen](/publications/totalberedskapsmeldingen-2025/) — a white paper with over 100 measures to strengthen civil resilience:

| Area | Key Measures |
|------|--------------|
| **Civil protection** | Sivilforsvaret expands from 8,000 to 12,000 personnel |
| **Shelters** | 1998 construction ban lifted — new buildings require shelters |
| **Food security** | 50% self-sufficiency target by 2030; 3-month grain reserves |
| **Cyber preparedness** | New public-private cooperation scheme for cyber incidents |
| **Governance** | Mandatory preparedness councils in all municipalities |

## Why Digital Preparedness Matters

Modern society cannot function without digital systems. This creates new vulnerabilities:

### The Threat Is Real

From [Norway's 2025 threat assessments](/blog/2025-12-15-hybrid-war-already-here/):

- **GPS jamming**: 294 days of jamming in Finnmark in 2023 — now so constant that tracking stopped
- **Sabotage**: 40 confirmed or planned Russian sabotage operations across Europe in 2024
- **Cyber attacks**: A Norwegian dam was hacked by pro-Russian actors in April 2025
- **Cable attacks**: Multiple undersea cables cut in the Baltic Sea

PST Chief Beate Gangås warned: *"The threats from state actors against Norway are more unpredictable, more extensive, and more demanding than in many decades."*

### Digital Dependencies Create Vulnerabilities

While Norway strengthens physical defences, digital dependencies grow:

- **63%** of the Norwegian cloud market is controlled by Microsoft
- **81%** is controlled by American companies
- **96%** of government agencies use cloud services
- All subject to the **US CLOUD Act**

### Three Pillars of Digital Resilience

**1. Data Sovereignty**

Data stored in Norway, under Norwegian jurisdiction, cannot be seized or blocked by foreign powers. This matters for sensitive data about critical infrastructure, defence, and citizens.

**2. Robust Systems**

Systems must be designed to function under attack. This means redundancy, offline capability, and rapid recovery.

**3. National Competence**

Norway needs its own expertise to operate critical digital infrastructure. Outsourcing to foreign actors creates vulnerability.

## Events in 2026

Throughout the year, conferences and exercises focus on total defence, cybersecurity, and digital preparedness.

{{< events >}}

### TFX26: The Main Event

**Øvelse Totalforsvar 2026 (TFX26)** in October will be Norway's largest total defence exercise since the Cold War. It will test:

- Civil-military cooperation
- Critical infrastructure resilience
- Digital crisis management
- Cross-sector coordination

Organizations in critical sectors should prepare for participation or impact.

## For IT Leaders and Security Professionals

Total Defence Year is an opportunity to elevate digital preparedness in your organization.

### Map Your Dependencies

- Where is your most critical data stored?
- Which providers are you dependent on?
- What happens if a cloud service becomes unavailable for a week?

[Use the NDSI framework →](/ndsi/)

### Explore Alternatives

Norwegian and European alternatives exist for most critical systems.

[Browse Norwegian providers →](/ndsi/)

### Understand Regulatory Requirements

[NIS2](/laws/nis2-directive/) and other regulations set new requirements for critical infrastructure security.

[Browse relevant laws →](/laws/)

### Build Exit Strategies

Can you export your data? How long would migration take? Have you tested recovery?
