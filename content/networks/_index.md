Norway's digital infrastructure—**subsea cables** and **land-based routes** both internationally and within the country—carries everything from government services to private communications.

**Why it matters:** Most Norwegian municipalities, agencies, and companies run critical systems on [datacenters outside Norway](/datacenters/). The data travels through cables owned by companies subject to foreign [jurisdictions](/jurisdictions/) and laws. Understanding this infrastructure is key to understanding Norway's digital sovereignty.

## Network Map

{{< network-map showSimulation="true" >}}

**Important:** This page documents what can be mapped from **public sources only**. There is no single official map of all connections in and out of Norway. For security and commercial reasons, exact routes of many backbones and seabed cables are not public.
