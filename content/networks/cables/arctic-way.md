## Overview

**Arctic Way** is a planned submarine cable system that will become the world's northernmost subsea cable. It will connect mainland Norway to **Jan Mayen** and **Svalbard**, replacing the aging Svalbard Fibre system and providing first-ever submarine fiber connectivity to Jan Mayen.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Status** | 🔶 Planned |
| **Ready for Service** | Q2 2028 |
| **Length** | 2,350 km |
| **Owner** | Space Norway AS |
| **System Supplier** | SubCom |
| **Cost** | NOK 2.8 billion (~$250M USD) |

## Route & Landing Points

The trunk-and-branch system will have direct shore-end landings in:

1. **Bodø** (mainland Norway) - 67°N
2. **Jan Mayen** - 71°N
3. **Longyearbyen, Svalbard** - 78°N

The entire system lies within the Arctic Circle (67-78°N).

## Strategic Importance

### Norwegian Sovereignty

> "Establishing a submarine fiber cable to Jan Mayen is important because it will strengthen the ability to understand the situation and provide an overview in a strategically important area for Norway and our allies."
> — *Minister of Defense Tore O. Sandvik*

### Key Benefits

- **Svalbard**: Replaces aging Svalbard Fibre (2004) before end of service life
- **Jan Mayen**: First submarine fiber connection (currently satellite only)
- **Defense**: Supports Norwegian Armed Forces operations in the Arctic
- **Research**: Enables scientific activities and satellite operations
- **State Control**: Under Norwegian state ownership via Space Norway

## Current Status

| Milestone | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Government Approval | ✅ Approved (Cabinet decision) |
| SubCom Contract | ✅ Signed, Contract-in-Force |
| Seabed Surveys | 📋 Planned Summer 2025 |
| Manufacturing | 📋 SubCom Newington, NH facility |
| Installation | 📋 Polar-certified Reliance Class vessel |
| Ready for Service | 📋 Q2 2028 |

## Backup Systems

The existing dual Svalbard Fibre cables will remain operational as backup:

> "While establishing new fibre infrastructure, we will continue to utilise the two existing cables to Svalbard as long as they remain functional, serving as a backup for Arctic Way."
> — *Rune Jensen, Director of Subsea Cable Systems, Space Norway*
