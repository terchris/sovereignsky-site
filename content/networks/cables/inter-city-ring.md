## Overview

**Inter-City Ring** is Bulk’s terrestrial fibre system connecting major Norwegian cities (commonly referenced as **Oslo, Kristiansand, Stavanger, and Bergen**).

Exact terrestrial routing is typically not published in detail. On the Networks map, it is therefore shown **schematically** between major endpoints.
