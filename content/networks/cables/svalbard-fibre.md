## Overview

The **Svalbard Undersea Cable System** is the existing submarine communications link between mainland Norway and **Svalbard**, operational since **2004**. Public sources describe it as a twin-cable system with two segments (via the Tromsø area).

Because detailed seabed routing is sensitive, many sources only provide high-level endpoints and segment structure.
