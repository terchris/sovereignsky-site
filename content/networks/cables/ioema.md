## Overview

**IOEMA** is a planned **repeatered** submarine fibre project connecting five northern European markets: **UK, Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, and Norway**.

Submarine Networks describes the system as:
- **~1,400 km**
- A **trunk route** from **Dumpton Gap (UK)** to **Kristiansand (Norway)**
- **Branches** to **Eemshaven (NL)**, **Wilhelmshaven (DE)**, and **Blaabjerg (DK)**
- **48 fibre pairs**

## Why it matters for Norway

- Adds another multi-country corridor out of southern Norway
- Increases route diversity in the North Sea region
