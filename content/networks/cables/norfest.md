## Overview

**NORFEST** (NORdic FESToon) is a fully buried submarine cable system that skirts the Norwegian coast, providing a 100% diverse route for connectivity between key Norwegian cities and datacenters.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Status** | ✅ Active |
| **Ready for Service** | December 2023 |
| **Length** | 749 km |
| **Fiber Pairs** | 48-96 |
| **Owner** | Tampnet |
| **Installation** | Cecon Contracting AS |
| **Cable Manufacturer** | Nexans |

## Unique Design

### Near-Shore Trench Route

NORFEST takes advantage of a deep trench just off the Norwegian coast that offers:

- **Natural protection** from fishing activity and anchors
- **Location within 12nm** of national waters (Coast Guard monitoring)
- **Full burial** possible for all 700+ km
- **Terrestrial benefits** (short distances between PoPs) combined with **subsea benefits** (weather protection, low disturbance risk)

### Festoon Topology

The festoon design connects 11+ key hubs along the route:
- All electronics hosted on land
- Low-maintenance passive fiber
- Multiple landing points for redundancy

## Landing Points

| Location | Region | Connection |
|----------|--------|------------|
| Egersund | Rogaland | Western terminus |
| Stavanger | Rogaland | Green Mountain DC |
| Kristiansand | Agder | International cables |
| Arendal/Tromøy | Agder | Branch landing |
| Larvik | Vestfold | Branch landing |
| Moss | Viken | Oslo Fjord |
| Drøbak | Viken | Oslo Fjord |
| Oslo | Oslo | Eastern terminus |
| + Sweden | Göteborg | International connection |

## Strategic Value

### Route Diversity

> "In July, we started the project from the Green Mountain location in Stavanger, through to Kristiansand. The North Sea is a difficult place to have, install and operate infrastructure."
> — *Carol Browne, Tampnet*

NORFEST provides:
- **100% diverse route** from existing terrestrial backhaul
- **High resilience** with low mean time to repair (MTTR)
- **Life-of-system access** for customers to install, maintain, and upgrade
- **No reliance on third-party infrastructure** (power lines, railways)

### Sustainability

All CLS (Cable Landing Station) huts along the route are installed with:
- Solar panels
- Horizontal directional drilling (HDD) at landfalls to preserve environment

## Installation Timeline
