## Why We Do This

Norway is investing billions in military defence — F-35 fighter jets, new submarines, expanded conscription. But while we prepare for physical threats, our digital infrastructure remains dangerously dependent on foreign powers.

We can't buy a bus ticket without American cloud services. Our hospitals, government agencies, and critical infrastructure all run on systems subject to the US CLOUD Act. A single political decision in Washington could disrupt Norwegian society more effectively than any military attack.

**SovereignSky exists to change this.**

We believe that digital sovereignty is not optional — it's a prerequisite for national resilience. And we believe that awareness must come before action. You can't solve a problem you don't see.

## What We Provide

SovereignSky is a **practical resource** for understanding and addressing digital sovereignty:

| Resource | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **[Laws Database](/laws/)** | 41 data sovereignty laws — understand your legal exposure |
| **[Datacenter Map](/datacenters/)** | 87 cloud locations — see where your data actually lives |
| **[Jurisdiction Profiles](/jurisdictions/)** | 66 legal frameworks — know the rules that apply |
| **[Software Database](/software/)** | Sovereignty risk assessments for common tools |
| **[NDSI Framework](/ndsi/)** | Self-assessment tool for organizations |
| **[Blog](/blog/)** | Analysis and news on digital sovereignty |

We also document **practical solutions** — open source infrastructure, Norwegian providers, and exit strategies that give organizations real alternatives.

## A helpers.no Initiative

SovereignSky is published by **[helpers.no](https://helpers.no)**, a Norwegian initiative focused on practical action during crisis.

### What helpers.no Has Done

**Ukraine Refugee Crisis (2022)**

When Russia invaded Ukraine and refugees began arriving in Norway, helpers.no coordinated volunteer efforts at an unprecedented scale:

- Operated **Europe's largest refugee transit center** at the Norway-Ukraine border reception
- Coordinated thousands of volunteers providing immediate assistance
- Built systems for matching refugees with housing, transport, and support
- Demonstrated that civil society can mobilize rapidly when needed

The experience reinforced a key insight: **preparedness requires infrastructure before the crisis hits**. You can't build coordination systems while the crisis is unfolding.

### Why Digital Sovereignty Now

The same principle applies to digital infrastructure. When a geopolitical crisis makes American cloud services unavailable or untrustworthy, it will be too late to build alternatives.

SovereignSky is that preparedness work — building awareness, documenting alternatives, and creating frameworks *before* they're urgently needed.

## Our Approach

### Open and Transparent

All content on SovereignSky is freely available. We believe sovereignty requires shared knowledge, not proprietary gatekeeping.

### Practical, Not Political

We focus on concrete actions organizations can take today. We're not advocating for any political position — we're providing tools for informed decisions.

### Norwegian and Nordic Focus

While digital sovereignty is a global issue, we focus on the Norwegian and Nordic context. Local alternatives, local regulations, local risks.

### Evidence-Based

Our databases draw from official sources, legal documents, and verifiable data. We cite our sources and welcome corrections.

## The Stakes

NSM Director Sofie Nystrøm warned: *"We are more vulnerable than we have been in a long time."*

Digital sovereignty is not about paranoia or protectionism. It's about resilience. It's about ensuring that Norwegian society can function even when geopolitical relationships change.

The question is not whether digital disruption will happen — but whether we'll be prepared when it does.
