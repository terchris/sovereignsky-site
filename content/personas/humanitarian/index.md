title: "Humanitarian"
summary: "NGOs and aid organizations"
description: "When crisis strikes, you're the ones who show up. You coordinate volunteers, locate the vulnerable, deliver aid. But your contact lists, your volunteer databases, your coordination tools — they're all on servers controlled by a foreign power. No one has physical archives anymore. If you can't organize, you can't help. Build your digital independence now, before the crisis that needs you arrives."
