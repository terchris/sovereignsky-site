Browse our database of software tools commonly used by Norwegian organizations. Each tool has been assessed using the Norwegian Digital Sovereignty Index (NDSI) framework, providing insights into:

- **Jurisdiction risks** - Is the vendor subject to foreign data access laws?
- **Data residency** - Can your data stay in Norway or the EU?
- **Technical sovereignty** - Do you control your data and can you migrate away?
- **Alternatives** - Norwegian and European options that may reduce risk

Use the filters above to find specific tools or explore by risk level and use area.
