The European Union is taking decisive action to address its overwhelming dependence on American cloud providers. In October 2025, the European Commission announced a €180 million tender for sovereign cloud services - a clear signal that digital sovereignty is now a strategic priority.

## The Problem: 70% US Control

European organizations face a stark reality: approximately 70% of EU cloud infrastructure is controlled by US hyperscalers - primarily Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. This creates significant concerns:

- **Legal jurisdiction conflicts** - US laws like the CLOUD Act can compel American providers to hand over data, regardless of where it's stored
- **Economic dependence** - Billions of euros flow to US tech giants annually
- **Strategic vulnerability** - Critical European infrastructure depends on foreign providers
- **Data protection uncertainty** - The EU-US Data Privacy Framework could be invalidated by courts, as happened with Safe Harbor and Privacy Shield

## The EU's Response: SEAL Framework

The EU has developed the **Sovereignty, European values, Autonomy, and Locality (SEAL)** framework to classify cloud services by their sovereignty level:

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **SEAL-0** | No sovereignty requirements |
| **SEAL-1** | Basic EU data residency |
| **SEAL-2** | EU-headquartered provider, EU data processing |
| **SEAL-3** | No foreign ownership, EU jurisdiction only |
| **SEAL-4** | Full sovereignty - EU owned, operated, and controlled |

This framework gives organizations a clear way to assess their cloud providers and make informed decisions based on their sovereignty requirements.

## €180 Million Investment

The European Commission's tender targets several key objectives:

1. **Develop EU-native cloud capacity** - Fund European cloud providers to scale their infrastructure
2. **Create interoperability standards** - Ensure portability between European providers
3. **Support public sector migration** - Help government agencies move to sovereign cloud solutions
4. **Build skills and expertise** - Develop European cloud engineering talent

## European Alternatives Growing

Several European cloud providers are positioning themselves as sovereign alternatives:

**France:**
- **Scaleway** - Part of Iliad Group, focused on developer experience
- **OVHCloud** - Europe's largest cloud provider, strong on data sovereignty

**Germany:**
- **Hetzner** - Known for competitive pricing and strong infrastructure
- **IONOS** - Business-focused cloud from United Internet

**Nordic:**
- **Elastx** (Sweden) - Kubernetes-native, GDPR-compliant
- **UpCloud** (Finland) - High-performance European cloud
- **NetNordic** (Norway) - Regional provider with sovereignty focus

## Cloud and AI Development Act

Alongside the funding initiative, the EU is advancing the **Cloud and AI Development Act**, which aims to:

- Establish common standards for cloud services in the EU
- Create certification schemes for sovereign cloud providers
- Define requirements for public sector cloud procurement
- Address AI training data sovereignty

## What This Means for Organizations

European organizations should:

1. **Understand your SEAL requirements** - What level of sovereignty do you actually need?
2. **Evaluate European alternatives** - Many can match hyperscaler capabilities for common workloads
3. **Plan for hybrid approaches** - Use sovereign cloud for sensitive data while maintaining flexibility
4. **Monitor regulatory developments** - Requirements are evolving rapidly
5. **Consider multi-cloud strategies** - Avoid trading one vendor lock-in for another

## The Bigger Picture

The EU's investment signals a long-term commitment to digital sovereignty. While European providers may not match the scale of AWS or Azure today, the combination of funding, regulation, and growing demand is creating conditions for a more competitive European cloud market.

For organizations in regulated industries, government, or those handling sensitive data, the question is no longer whether to consider sovereign cloud options - it's how quickly to move.
